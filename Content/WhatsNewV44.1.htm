        <p>The Winter 2017 Release (V44.1, Update 20) kicked off Phase 1 of the EMS&#160;G Suite Integration. This integration combines the scheduling power of the EMS platform with the convenience of G Suite. Given the complexity of this integration, we’re taking a multi-phased approach to development. </p>
        <p>This first phase  is named “Google Calendar Integration, and allows access to G Suite users’ Google Calendars to provide their free/busy statuses within EMS for scheduling meetings. Everyday users can see attendee availability directly within the EMS Web App or Mobile App alongside space availability information from the EMS database. When creating a booking, users can easily compare room availability alongside invitee availability to find a day and time that works for the right people and in the right space. The integration also sends invitations to attendee’s Gmail and Calendars.</p>
        <p>The next two phases will be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Phase 2 – EMS for Google Calendar</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Phase 3 – Google Room Calendar Integration (GRCI)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EMS&#160;Campus Improvements</h3>

        <p>The Fall 2017 Release (V44.1, Update 17) contained extensive updates to the EMS Kiosk App. The EMS Kiosk App included an enhanced user interface, as well as functionality that has simplified and expedited the booking process. Additionally, it is easier to project your brand.</p>

        <h3>Redesigned EMS Room Sign App (formerly Glance)</h3>
        <p>As of Update 12, significant changes were made to the former EMS Glance product. The Update renames Glance to the EMS Room Sign App and also greatly updates the visual design. You might have to manually refresh the EMS&#160;Room Sign App page on each tablet following your upgrade. To refresh the page on an iPad, you should close the browser and  re-open it using the homelink. We are working to ensure you will not have to do so in the future.</p>
        <p>Upgrading to any release after Update 7 was causing end users to see an error message on the tablet. The browser on each tablet had to be restarted to eliminate the error. After upgrading to Update 15, end users will no longer see the error message.</p>
        <h2>V44.1, Update 12</h2>
        <p>In 2017, development of the EMS Platform has been guided by three areas of focus: Architecture, Integrations, and User Experience.
