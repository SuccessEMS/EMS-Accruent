        <h1>Get Started with EMS Kiosk App</h1>
        <p>EMS Kiosk App is a powerful yet easy-to-use interactive tool for reviewing room availability, booking space, searching for a meeting location, and more. This EMS Everyday User Application allows users to see their reservations or make new ones from touch screen devices typically mounted near meeting spaces, lobbies, and at check-in areas. When paired with the optional EMS Floor Plans utility, you can give users an added measure of convenience as they see reserved/available space on a facility diagram, making it even easier to find a meeting or a place to hold one.</p>

        <p>Run on a touch-screen display unit, EMS Kiosk App is a powerful yet easy-to-use digital room sign and interactive tool for reviewing room availability, booking space, searching for a meeting location and more. Kiosks are typically mounted outside a room and/or in a lobby or entryway. Everyday users interact with kiosks to view today’s events, make a reservation, view their existing reservations, locate a person who has reservations for today, and, if enabled, view floor plans and check into and out of a building.</p>
