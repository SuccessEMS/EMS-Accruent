        <p>If you choose not to install Update 33 or later of EMS&#160;Web App, keep in mind that users will be able to deselect the <span class="ui">Add to Calendar/Send Invitations</span> checkbox for reservations created on Exchange-enabled templates. Deselecting the checkbox will prevent organizer and room/resource availability from syncing to Exchange and appearing on Outlook calendars.</p>
