        <h1>Architecture</h1>
        <p>In June 2017, the EMS Mobile App was implemented with EMS Platform Services. As of January 2018, the EMS&#160;Kiosk App and EMS&#160;for Outlook have both been placed on the EMS&#160;Platform Services layer. In the future, all EMS applications will consume the Platform Services layer.&#160;</p>
        <p>For our clients and partners, EMS&#160;Platform Services provides a platform for faster, more straightforward custom integrations. Clients will experience a more valuable,&#160;consistent user experience across all EMS products. In addition, features and enhancements across all access points will experience faster turnaround times. Platform Services has empowered EMS to be a true enterprise solution.&#160;</p>
