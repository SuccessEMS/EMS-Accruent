        <h1>What Is RoomWizard Integration?</h1>
        <p class="NormalWeb_11">The EMS RoomWizard Interface is an optional module for communicating room reservation information between EMS and&#160;<a href="https://www.steelcase.com/products/scheduling-systems/roomwizard/" title="https://www.steelcase.com/products/scheduling-systems/roomwizard/">Steelcase RoomWizard</a>. A RoomWizard is a wall-mounted unit that is associated with a particular room and used to schedule and view events in it.</p>
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb_2">Once a connection has been established between a specific unit and an EMS database, EMS booking information is automatically displayed on the RoomWizard device for that room.&#160; In addition, new impromptu meetings and adjustments to existing meetings made directly on a RoomWizard unit are automatically relayed to the EMS database.&#160;</p>
        <h2>How Do I Install It?</h2>
        <p class="p_26">To integrate EMS with Steelcase RoomWizard, you will:</p>
