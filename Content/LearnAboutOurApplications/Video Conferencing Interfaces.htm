        <h1>Video Conferencing Interfaces: Cisco's TMS and Polycom</h1>
        <p class="NormalWeb_2">EMS eliminates the complexities of scheduling video conferencing through automatic features and integration tools, which enable you to:</p>
        <ul class="ul_5">
            <li class="li_15">Select multiple endpoints, such as conference locations</li>
            <li class="li_15">Auto-add equipment within a reservation</li>
            <li class="li_15">Link video conferences as a resources to specific spaces</li>
            <li class="li_15">Sync all bookings by time zone</li>
            <li class="li_15">Create detailed Video Conference&#160;Setup Worksheets for coordinators</li>
            <li class="li_15">Automatically replicate reservations into your Video Conferencing&#160;system</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="NormalWeb_14">Once an expert user has confirmed a VC&#160;reservation, EMS transmits the request details to the external VC booking platform. The department responsible for the technology completes the reservation as specified, approves and adds locations and details such as turn-on time.&#160;</p>
