        <h1>How Does EMS Organize Buildings, Rooms, and Areas?</h1>
        <p class="NormalWeb">In EMS, your organization's office is made up of locations, spaces, and users.&#160;</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4_1">Locations</h4>
        <p class="NormalWeb_2">A physical area representing multiple spaces. Depending on how large your company is, it could be anything from "West Coast HQ" to a campus-level "Mail Room 6" &#160;and can contain&#160;multiple rooms, buildings, and other spaces.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4_1">Areas</h4>
        <p class="NormalWeb_2">Similar to locations, and area can also include multiple locations, and helps you group locations, buildings, and rooms by your own organization's&#160;</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4_1">Buildings</h4>
        <p class="NormalWeb_2">A physical building containing rooms, with pre-defined equipment and service options. Buildings belong to Locations.&#160;</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4_1">Rooms</h4>
        <p class="NormalWeb_2">Rooms with pre-defined equipment and service options. Rooms&#160;belong to a Building. You can think of the hierarchy like this: Your Company&#160;&gt; New York HQ &gt; Client Consultation Area &gt; Central Park Building &gt; Nicest Conference Room</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4_1">Users</h4>
        <p class="NormalWeb_2">When you add users in EMS, how you define their user profiles and booking templates control whether they will&#160;be able to schedule&#160;events in the rooms you've configured.&#160;</p>
