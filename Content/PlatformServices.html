        <h1>EMS Platform Services</h1>
        <p>EMS Platform Services is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution offering modern, RESTful APIs. Platform Services enables the development of multi-platform applications that&#160;can be customized, cloud-based, scalable and easily integrated. &#160;It&#160;is a true middle tier, providing a business and resource layer&#160;that enables the central development of applications, reducing complexity and development time. Platform Services fosters innovation by ensuring&#160;easy maintenance and efficient management of an application's life cycle.</p>
        <p>In the current EMS architecture, databases exchange business logic directly with applications in the business tier.&#160;The Platform Services architecture creates an intermediary layer of business logic and resources that provides a buffer between the applications and EMS databases. Fixes, enhancements and/or new features can now be dispersed simultaneously to all products through Platform Services.</p>
