        <h1>Microsoft Outlook, EMS for Microsoft Outlook, and EMS Web App Comparison</h1>
        <p>The EMS for Outlook add-in provides one-click access to self-service room reservation, managed spaces, and resource booking using the familiar Outlook personal scheduling interface. Users can find available rooms, reserve them and book resources, such as A/V equipment or catering, all from within Microsoft Outlook.</p>
        <p>The EMS Web App provides robust, real-time access to scheduling information via an internet browser. A broad range of scheduling options and scheduling scenarios are supported easily. Authorized users can, depending on the level of access granted, submit room requests or create self-service reservations directly. Users can create basic or advanced reservations, schedule resources, view building schedules, or search for specific events.</p>
        <p>Some important points to note about the EMS for Outlook add-in as compared to Microsoft Outlook and the EMS Web App are the following:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>For complex room reservations and resource management (such as copying a reservation), the EMS Desktop Client application might be preferred.</li>
            <li>Simple routine reservations made using the EMS for Outlook add-in generally follow the same rules as simple Outlook reservations.</li>
            <li>The add-in supports existing Outlook delegation assignments; however, the everyday user accounts must have the same corresponding delegation settings.</li>
            <li>The add-in can be used just like Microsoft Outlook to schedule regular recurring appointments (day and time). EMS for Outlook does not support recurring appointments without an end date.&#160;</li>
            <li>Just like reservations created in the EMS Web App, EMS for Outlook reservations abide by the rules of the Web Process template and the EMS Web App settings of the applicable categories and resources. The ability to modify and cancel EMS for Outlook reservations (dates, time, rooms, services and/or resources) are determined by these rules and the restrictions of Microsoft Outlook and Exchange.</li>
        </ul>
