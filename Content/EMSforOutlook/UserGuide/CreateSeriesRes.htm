            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Create a Series Reservation</h1>
        <p>A Series Reservation is a single reservation that includes multiple bookings. EMS for Outlook allows you to search for rooms that are available at a particular time on multiple days to create a series reservation. This section details the creation of a series reservation for a non-video conference meeting. For information about scheduling a video conference meeting, see&#160;<a href="CreateVideoConRes.htm">Create a Video Conference Reservation</a>.</p>
        <p><a name="ToCreateASeriesReservation"></a>To create a series reservation:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="number-list">
            <li>Open Microsoft Outlook and click <span class="ui">New Meeting </span>to begin your reservation. Specify the subject, attendees, date, and time.</li>
            <li>Click&#160;the&#160;<span class="ui">Recurrence&#160;</span>button.<div class="TitleandImage"><p class="Caption"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Using EMS for Outlook/Creating a Single Reservation_4.png" class="popup_with_padding_only" /></p></div><div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><p>The Start Time and End Time are designated when you set up the meeting in Outlook. You can edit these values in EMS for Outlook&#160;via the date and time fields or later after booking.&#160;</p></div></li>
            <li>In the Appointment Recurrence dialog box, specify the Appointment Time, Recurrence pattern, Range of recurrence, and End by Date.&#160;Click&#160;<span class="ui">OK</span>.&#160;<div class="ImportantNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #990000;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Important! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><p>Ensure you set an End Date for the recurrence. EMS for Outlook does not support infinite recurring meetings.</p></div></li>
            <li>Click the&#160;<span class="ui">EMS Room Manager</span>&#160;icon in the top menu bar of Outlook.</li>
            <li>Select a Template from the drop-down list (the list contains pre-defined templates set by your System Administrator).&#160;</li>
            <li>Select a Room. By default, for a recurring meeting, EMS for Outlook opens in the List view. The List view shows the availability for all rooms. The list will include a&#160;<span class="ui">Days Available</span> column. This feature allows you to view how many days the space is available during your recurrence date range (e.g., 10/10 days). Click the&#160;<span class="ui">Select </span>(<span class="ui">+</span>)&#160;button on the left to select your room. If your room is available for all of your days, continue creating your reservation.</li>
            <li>If the room you selected is not available for all days (e.g., only 8/10 days), the&#160;Resolve Conflicts&#160;dialog box will appear. (For example, for a recurrent meeting with 10 meeting dates, Demo Room 06&#160;is available for 8 out of the 10 meeting dates.)</li>
            <li>Choose a location that is available for the remaining dates during your recurrence and click the green&#160;<span class="ui">Select </span>(<span class="ui">+</span>)&#160;button.<div class="ImportantNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #990000;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Important! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><p>If the user does not want to choose a room that resolves the conflict, they can skip the resolve conflicts process. Dates that are skipped will not be assigned a room and the location field in the meeting in Outlook will not be populated. The user can review the reservation at a later date and choose rooms for the skipped dates.</p></div></li>
            <li>Optionally, click on the&#160;<span class="ui">Selected Locations</span>&#160;tab to view information about the selected room(s), such as Days Available, Location, Floor, Building, Location Type, Capacity, and Attendee Count. If needed, you can click the red Remove button to remove the room for the scheduled event or the Edit button to make changes.&#160;<div class="TitleandImage"><p class="Caption">Selected Location Tab</p><p class="Caption"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Using EMS for Outlook/Creating a Single Reservation_5.png" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/6620/EMSforOutlook_CreateaSeriesReservation_SelectedLocation.png?revision=1&amp;size=bestfit&amp;width=842&amp;height=157" class="popup_with_padding_only" /></p></div></li>

            <li>To add a Skype for Business meeting to your event, click the&#160;<span class="ui">Skype Meeting</span>&#160;icon.&#160;The Skype icon will only appear if you have the Skype for Business Add-in enabled.</li>
            <li>Click&#160;<span class="ui">Send</span>. The selected room is booked in the EMS database. The event is automatically added to your Outlook calendar. The invited meeting attendees receive a standard invitation for the meeting. The invitees accept or decline the meeting invitation as they normally would in Outlook. The EMS Reservation ID is included in the body of the meeting invitation.</li>
