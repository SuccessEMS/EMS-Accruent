        <h1>Create a Video Conference Reservation</h1>
        <p>You can create a video conference reservation for both a single reservation and a series reservation. When you create a video conference reservation, two room options are available:</p>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>The room is a dedicated video conferencing room. (The room has built-in video conferencing features.)</li>
            <li>The room has no built-in video conferencing features. Instead, you must use a mobile video conferencing cart in the room.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To create a video conference reservation, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol class="number-list">
