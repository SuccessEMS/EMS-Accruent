                        <li><span class="ui">On Premise: </span>This deployment for Skype for Business does not retain a token and requires authentication every 8 hours. As a result, you will be asked to sign in every 8 hours.&#160;</li>
                        <li><span class="ui">Online:</span> This deployment retains the token so only an initial authentication is required.&#160;</li>
                        <li><span class="ui">Hybrid:</span> This deployment has the same authentication method as the Online deployment.</li>
                    </ol>
