        <h1>Add Services to a Booking</h1>
        <p>You can add services to a booking provided that the room, booking template, and event type allow it to be added. You will only see allowable services when adding them to an event.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>To add services to a meeting, click the <span class="ui">Services </span>tab from the Meeting. If the tab is not available, your Administrator has not designated services for the booking template you are using.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For one-time bookings, the <span class="ui">Services </span>tab lists your booking, and it is already selected. The center panel shows services available for the selected room booking.</li>
                    <li>For recurrent meetings, multiple bookings are listed in the left panel. You will need to select the booking for which you want to add special services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Depending on your administrator's settings, a room might offer the following types of services (in the central panel):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Catering</li>
                    <li>Resources with or without Service Orders</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Notes</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
                    <p>Unlike other EMS applications, you cannot specify services that are Activities or Attendees.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the Category of service in the center panel you want to work with. </p>
                <p>The right panel refreshes to show (expandable) options available in that category.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make your selections and click the<span class="ui"> Apply</span> or <span class="ui">Apply to Multiple</span> button.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> If you select <span class="ui">Apply to Multiple</span> (typically for recurrent meetings), the Apply to Additional Bookings pop-up dialog appears, where you can select which room bookings should have the service included.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make your selections and click <span class="ui">Apply</span>. </p>
                <p>The services are added to your bookings and the <span class="ui">Services </span>tab refreshes to reflect your changes.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
