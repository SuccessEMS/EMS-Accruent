        <p>If you are unsure whether your organization is licensed for the FM Toolkit, or if you would like to learn more about it, please contact your Account Executive.</p>
        <p>To integrate EMS FM Toolkit, you will:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>Determine the data sources in your organization that will connect facilities management data to EMS.</li>
            <li>Prepare your facilities management data for sharing with EMS.</li>
            <li>Obtain and load the installation components, which are .sql files to establish a database where data will be staged for exchange between EMS and your data source(s).</li>
            <li>Run FM Toolkit to initiate data exchange between EMS and your data source(s).</li>
            <li>Maintain data in your facilities management systems for continual integration with EMS.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How EMS Integrates Your User Records</h2>
        <p>During the configuration process, you establish&#160;an inventory of buildings and rooms in the EMS staging database. Everyday users can then use this inventory of space&#160;to book meetings and reservations.&#160;Facilities management (FM) systems outside of EMS solutions are also built upon an inventory of buildings and rooms.&#160;The FM Toolkit enables organizations to synchronize&#160;the space inventory between these two systems.</p>
        <p>The FM Toolkit Installation Guide&#160;leads you through the steps to&#160;install and configure the FM Toolkit in your environment, and explains special considerations for preparing and maintaining your source data.</p>
