        <h1>EMS API Requirements and Licensing</h1>
        <p>The EMS API allows&#160;other platforms (or applications) a conduit for access to the data contained in EMS. This may include reading data&#160;<span class="italics">from&#160;</span>or sending data&#160;to&#160;the EMS database. The EMS API is commonly connected to another API or database via integration point, or ‘hook’, usually a third party application or web service. EMS Software does not provide this additional component (or offer support) to create the connection from the external application to the EMS API, as we are an open framework to it.</p>
        <h2>EMS API Requirements&#160;</h2>
        <p>The latest version of EMS must be installed, plus additional requirements and prerequisites for each EMS Component you want to interact with via API. See&#160;<a href="../../../EMS_SystemReq_44.1.html">EMS V44.1 System Requirements</a>.</p>
        <h2>EMS API Licensing&#160;</h2>
        <p>The Basic API and the Advanced API are both optional system features that may be licensed by EMS customers. Note that the Advanced API includes the Basic API.</p>
        <p>The Advanced API provides all of the calls to pull data (i.e. “get” calls) from the EMS database.&#160;Calls to update or add reservations/bookings (i.e. “update” and “add” calls) also require the Advanced API. If you are unsure whether or not your organization is licensed for the API, or if you would like to learn more, please contact your Account Executive.</p>
