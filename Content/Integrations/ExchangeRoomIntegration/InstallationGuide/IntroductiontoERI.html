        <h1>Introduction to Exchange Room Integration (ERI)</h1>
        <h2>What Is ERI?</h2>
        <p>Exchange Room Integration (ERI) is an add-on module that provides the ability to configure EMS rooms and resources to invite Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Exchange resource mailboxes, simplifying integrations with third-party technology, such as video conference systems. Bookings made by everyday users in EMS will handle the addition of the technologies, without the need for a separate process. </p>
        <p>ERI is a simplified integration tool that allows clients to utilize their EMS software to its fullest potential. ERI&#160;allows enhanced integration of resources and technology during the EMS booking process&#160;for managed spaces. Exchange Room Integration&#160;simplifies the booking process and provides a cohesive and powerful way to book and manage resources.&#160;EMS Exchange Room Integration will&#160;take your resource scheduling to the next level.</p>
        <h3>Features:</h3>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Allows integration of third-party technology (e.g., video conference [VC]&#160;device or display panels) to a booking in EMS by linking to a Microsoft<sup>®&#160;</sup>Exchange resource mailbox</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Automatically includes fixed-room resources in&#160;the room booking (e.g., collaboration devices) through the Microsoft<sup>®&#160;</sup>Exchange resource mailboxes</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Allows integration of non-fixed resources (e.g., Mobile Microsoft Surface Hubs) during the booking process</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How ERI Works</h2>
        <p>Once an&#160;everyday user adds a technology/resource&#160;to a booking&#160;using EMS for Outlook, EMS Web App, or the EMS Mobile App, ERI will seamlessly integrate the resource to the booking through the Microsoft<sup>®&#160;</sup>Exchange resource&#160;(room/equipment) mailbox.&#160;EMS Exchange Room Integration (ERI) allows users to book in-room resource technologies seamlessly.</p>
