        <h2>Web Browsers and Mobile Devices</h2>
        <p>EMS Web App enables web users to view and book space on-the-go&#160;using any web browser application. EMS Mobile App provides similar functionality for smaller mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. As an administrator, you define web users' security access and booking options in EMS Desktop Client, including guests and temporary visitors.</p>
        <h2>Toolkits&#160;and Data Interfaces</h2>
        <p>EMS software is infinitely configurable; to simplify this effort, we&#160;provide toolkits and web services that enable&#160;you to import and export real-time data between systems and initiate automated bookings with other software applications.&#160;Using the EMS tools and services, you can:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>Eliminate duplicate information and planning mistakes.</li>
            <li>Provide timely updates of any new or altered user information.</li>
            <li>Link and sync calendars with scheduling.</li>
            <li>Coordinate service and resource usage with the proper systems.</li>
            <li>Ensure the right users have the right privileges.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reporting</h3>
        <p>EMS provides more than 110 reports and a custom query builder for use throughout the meeting and event lifecycle—from setup and invoicing to billing and utilization analysis. These&#160;"one-way integration" reports generate static reservation, service, billing, resource, and other information in .xml, .xls, comma-delimited, and&#160;.txt formats. This data&#160;can be read and parsed by many other&#160;software applications. These reports are categorized as follows:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li><span class="ui">Daily:</span>&#160;Summary, service, and other reports that describe activities over one or more days.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Sales:</span>&#160;Details of sales associated with reservations, resources, and more.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Statistics:</span>&#160;Insights you need to understand use and organizational activity.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Exception:</span>&#160;Clarifies the incorrectly run or allocated resources, templates, or systems.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Billing:</span>&#160;All reports for transactions, invoices, and other statements.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Hoteling:</span>&#160;Reports specific to office hoteling practices and QR codes for room cards.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Other:</span>&#160;Summary reports on cancellations and reservations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can send reports according to whatever frequency, time, time zone, and reporting period you choose, and you can customize the sender, subject, and message information. To set up Automated Reports, your organization will need to install and configure the EMS Automated Report service.</p>
        <h3>QR Codes</h3>
        <p>You can associate rooms with QR Codes: EMS Desktop Client provides a report that&#160;generates the codes and associates them with the designated rooms. You can&#160;print room cards that attendees can then scan or swipe (on room signs or using mobile devices)&#160;to&#160;see check-in&#160;to meetings.&#160;</p>
        <h3>End-Point Software Integrations</h3>
        <p>EMS Software partners with a wide array of software application providers who&#160;work with customers on common integrations, such as digital signage and end-point user software. To learn more about those partners and best practices, please contact your Account Executive.</p>
        <h2>APIs</h2>
        <p>You can use our APIs&#160;to develop your own custom solutions for taking data from&#160;EMS&#160;and using it elsewhere, to&#160;display information on calendars, websites, digital signage, and to&#160;integrate&#160;with third-party service systems.&#160;</p>

        <h2>Security: Integrated Windows Authentication</h2>
        <p>EMS integration with Active Directory (AD / LDAP) lets your organization use your HR data, such as existing user records and accounts, as the sign-in credentials for EMS. As employee information and status change, this integration updates to EMS at a chosen frequency, reading groups and assigning roles based on that information.&#160;Additionally, you can easily reference your existing&#160;AD / LDAP information&#160;as Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication.&#160;</p>
        <p>See Also:&#160;<a href="../Authentication/WindowsAuthen.html">Integrated Windows Authentication</a></p>
        <h2>Digital Signage: Video Displays, Tablets, and Room Signs</h2>
        <p>Placed outside the entrance to meeting rooms, wall-mounted digital signs with EMS software allow employees to book themselves into reservable spaces.&#160;EMS provides the following, optional licenses to integrate with digital tablets and room signs. See Also:&#160;<a href="../EMSPlatformServices/ConfigurationGuide/ConfigPSinAdminPortal.html#Integrations">Integrations in EMS&#160;Platform Services</a>. </p>
        <h3>EMS Kiosk</h3>
        <p>Run on a touch-screen display unit, EMS Kiosk is a powerful yet easy-to-use digital room sign and interactive tool for reviewing room availability, booking space, searching for a meeting location and more. Mount the unit outside a room and/or make an EMS Kiosk available in a lobby or entryway. Pair with the optional EMS Floor Plan module and give users an added measure of convenience as they see reserved/available space on a facility diagram, making it even easier to find &#160;and hold meeting space.&#160;</p>

        <p>The EMS Video Display Interface&#160;(VDI) is an&#160;add-on component that exports meeting and event information to a video display system such as Janus, Target Vision, and so on.&#160;</p>
        <h2>HVAC</h2>
        <p>Unused space often has heating, cooling, and other utilities continually running — equating to a large, unnecessary expense. Compliant with green initiatives and LEED certification,&#160;EMS API and Facilities Management Toolkit&#160;help&#160;organizations reduce costs: they can be configured to&#160;integrate&#160;with third-party&#160;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems (such as EVENTS2HVAC™&#160;by Streamside Solutions)&#160;to automate heating and cooling based on room usage.</p>
        <h2>Geolocation, Mapping, and&#160;Floorplans&#160;</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.Mobile" /> integrates with mobile devices' geographic mapping functionality to enable users to locate nearby rooms and to book space and check into meetings. For more detailed EMS applications like EMS Web App and EMS Glance, building floorplans and room layout images can be configured to visually show user location, room proximity and location on a campus and on a floor, and room drawings.</p>
        <h2>Billing and Payment&#160;</h2>
        <p>EMS seamlessly integrates with industry-standard billing and payment systems.</p>
