        </h1>
        <p>Once rooms and resources have been configured for Exchange Room Integration (ERI), users can add these rooms or resources to a booking, and ERI will integrate the resource to the booking through the Microsoft<sup>®&#160;</sup>Exchange resource&#160;(room/equipment) mailbox.&#160;</p>
        <p>ERI&#160;also provides bi-directional (2-way) syncing—Exchange to EMS and EMS to Exchange. By syncing booking data in both directions, room and resource availability is correctly maintained and displayed in Exchange calendars. Depending on your configuration and the EMS&#160;product being used (for example, EMS&#160;Web App), ERI&#160;can also keep user availability up-to-date in Exchange calendars.</p>
        <p>The following sections provide more information about how these sync methods work:</p>

        <ul>

        <h3><a name="Cancel_a_Booking_from_a_Native_Exchange_Application"></a>Cancel a Booking from a Native Exchange Application</h3>
        <p>When users cancel bookings from native Exchange applications, the information is synced and the booking is canceled in EMS.&#160;Also, the room/resource availability is updated and reflected in the room/resource Exchange calendar.</p>
        <h3><a name="Benefits_and_Considerations"></a>Benefits and Considerations for Using <MadCap:variable name="General.Exchange-to-EMS" /> Sync</h3>
        <p>Many types of work groups use Microsoft® Outlook alone (without EMS) to find and book meeting spaces. Users are accustomed to setting up a meeting in an Outlook or an Exchange-enabled client, inviting attendees, and then clicking on the Rooms button to locate space within their office. With ERI, these types of users can continue to use their non-EMS&#160;processes for booking self-service spaces through Microsoft Outlook (referred to as native Outlook booking), and organizations can capture the space utilization statistics of native Outlook bookings in EMS.</p>
        <h4><a name="Benefits"></a>Benefits</h4>
        <p>The following types of users and organizations can benefit from the ERI&#160;<MadCap:variable name="General.Exchange-to-EMS"></MadCap:variable>&#160;Sync:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>EMS&#160;customers who want to maintain existing processes for booking self-service meeting rooms through native Outlook. </b>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Organizations with smaller, isolated offices with few meeting rooms or no distinct room booking workflows.</b>
                </p>
                <p>Rather than give users in these smaller offices a new tool, the users can continue to book spaces in native Outlook applications, and the room booking information will be synced from Exchange to EMS. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Organizations that have Macintosh-based work groups/employees who use Outlook for Macintosh to book self-service meeting rooms.</b>
                </p>
                <p>The ERI&#160;Exchange to EMS&#160;sync would allow users to continue using their familiar platform and tools. The Mac users could book rooms in Outlook, but the organization would be able to capture and calculate the utilization information for these rooms in EMS.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Users with the Outlook mobile app and Outlook Web access would benefit.</b>
                    <br>
                    </br>
                </p>
                <p>For example, without the ERI&#160;sync, if users changed the meeting time/date in the Outlook mobile app, the meeting time/date would change for the users on their Outlook calendar, but the time/date for the booking would not change in EMS. With the ERI&#160;sync, ERI&#160;would recognize booking edits made from the Outlook mobile app, and after ERI&#160;syncs the edited booking, the booking in EMS&#160;would be updated. <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2019-05-13T13:47:42.0902838-06:00" MadCap:creator="Megan.Laub" MadCap:initials="ME" MadCap:comment="Maybe not mention? \r\nAdmins can generate reports " MadCap:editor="Megan.Laub" MadCap:editDate="2019-05-13T17:37:08.9324948-06:00">Any conflicts would trigger a configured EMS&#160;conflict workflow. </MadCap:annotation></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Users who book self-service meeting rooms on an impromptu basis, such as using a kiosk or a digital room sign that references a Microsoft Exchange calendar.  </b>
                </p>
                <p>This type of user does not book meetings prior to the meeting time. Instead, the user locates available space and reserves the space using a kiosk or digital room sign. With ERI, these impromptu, on-the-spot bookings would be synced and captured in EMS. </p>
            </li>

        </h4>
        <p>The following is a list of considerations  and limitations to keep in mind for ERI&#160;Exchange to EMS&#160;Sync:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Organizations with hundreds or thousands of self-service spaces are not good candidates for this functionality. </b>
                </p>
                <p>Microsoft Outlook offers no filtering capabilities, so users would not be able to filter spaces, like they can in EMS, by location, capacity, type, or room features, and users would need to know the name of the space they want to reserve. In this scenario, an EMS access point would provide a better user experience since users would be able to filter appropriate spaces and save their favorites for quick access.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Organizations that have spaces that require an approval are not good candidates for the functionality, as it is designed for self-service meeting rooms only.</b>
                </p>
                <p>If there are spaces that require an approval workflow, the spaces would have to be managed EMS and outside of Exchange applications. This would create confusion with users because they would have to use different applications and processes to access both types of spaces.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Organizations that wish to enforce booking rules would not find the ERI&#160;Exchange to EMS&#160;sync a good fit.</b>
                </p>
                <p>While Exchange can provide limited <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2019-05-14T19:24:21.7995340-06:00" MadCap:creator="Megan.Laub" MadCap:initials="ME" MadCap:comment="such as??"

If your organization desires greater control on how users can book spaces, a workflow using an EMS client would be more appropriate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Organizations that want to allow the addition of services to a reservation would not find this functionality useful.</b>
                </p>
                <p>While EMS allows users to include service orders (such as catering, room setup, and audio-visual equipment) with their reservation, the service order feature will not be available in the self-service workflows through Microsoft Outlook.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Organizations that want custom information with reservations should not use the ERI&#160;Exchange to EMS&#160;sync.</b>
                </p>
                <p>Self-service workflows through Outlook do not provide the ability to specify custom information about a reservation, nor do they allow the ability to assign a billing code or chargeback information to the reservations. If you require billing or chargeback information for spaces, the ERI&#160;Exchange to EMS&#160;sync is not an appropriate solution.</p>
