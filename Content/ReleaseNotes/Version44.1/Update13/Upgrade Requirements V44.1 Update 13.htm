        <p>Before upgrading, please read the important upgrade considerations below.</p>
        <h2>EMS Room Sign App (formerly Glance)&#160;</h2>
        <p>Update 12 includes significant changes to the former EMS Glance product. The Update renames Glance to the EMS Room Sign App and also greatly updates the visual design.&#160;You may have to manually refresh the Room Sign App page on each tablet following your upgrade. To refresh the page on an iPad, you should close the browser and &#160;re-open it using the homelink. We are working to ensure you will not have to do so in the future.</p>
