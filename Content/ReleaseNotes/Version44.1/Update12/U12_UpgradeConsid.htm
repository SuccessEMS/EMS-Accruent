            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Upgrade Considerations</h1>
        <p class="NormalWeb">Before upgrading, please read the important upgrade considerations below.</p>
        <h2>EMS Room Sign App (formerly Glance)</h2>
        <p class="p_4">Update 12 includes significant changes to the former EMS Glance product. The Update renames Glance to the EMS Room Sign App and also greatly updates the visual design.&#160;You may have to manually refresh the Room Sign App page on each tablet following your upgrade. To refresh the page on an iPad, you should close the browser and &#160;re-open it using the homelink. We are working to ensure you will not have to do so in the future.</p>
        <h2>EMS Mobile App</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb">The EMS Mobile App Update 7 version will be removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store on July 7, 2017.</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb">EMS Mobile App Update 12 is compatible with Platform Services Update 12, as well as previous versions.&#160;Platform Services Update 12 is NOT compatible with previous versions of EMS Mobile App. Customers upgrading to Platform Services Update 12 must upgrade to EMS Mobile App Update 12.</p>
