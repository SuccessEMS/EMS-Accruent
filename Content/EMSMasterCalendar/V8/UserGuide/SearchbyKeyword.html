        <p>Whether you are searching for events and special dates, or you are searching for other&#160;information in other areas of Master Calendar, the page from which you are carrying the search always has a field into which you can enter partial or complete search criteria. This&#160;search field is frequently named “Keyword,” but is also can be named something else such as&#160;Title or Description.</p>
        <p>A search&#160;from a Master Calendar page is not case-sensitive and the search&#160;is limited to the exact order of characters in the search string and typically, the string can&#160;appear anywhere in the search results. For example, if you enter “ball” as your search string,&#160;search results can include Football, Baseball, Ballgame, and so on. In addition, the search&#160;string can appear in any information that is associated with the item for which you are&#160;searching. For example, if you are searching for an event, the search results can appear in the&#160;event name, the event description, and so on.&#160;Some searches that are accessible only to a Master Calendar site administrator&#160;require that the search results begin with the search string.<br /></p>
