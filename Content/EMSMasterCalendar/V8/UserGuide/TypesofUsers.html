        <h1>Types of EMS&#160;Master Calendar Users</h1>
        <p>Your system administrator establishes different types of users, who can perform different actions in EMS Master Calendar.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>guest user&#160;</strong>can submit a request to post an event to a public calendar.</li>
            <li>A <strong>calendar&#160;requester </strong>can submit a request to post an event to a public calendar and to any private&#160;calendars to which they have been granted access.</li>
            <li>If the <b>calendar manager</b> approves the&#160;request, the event is posted to the calendar. The calendar manager can also deny the request.&#160;After the calendar manager approves or denies request, the system automatically generates&#160;an email to the requestor, informing the requestor&#160;of the calendar manager’s decision.</li>
            <li>A <strong>calendar user</strong> can post events directly to a public calendar and to any private calendars to&#160;which they have been granted access without the calendar manager’s approval.</li>
        </ul>
