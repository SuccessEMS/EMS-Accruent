        <h1>Configure Event Types</h1>
        <p class="Body">An <i>event type</i> is a colored label that you can apply to an event in Master Calendar to make it easier for your guests and users to distinguish between different events, know the purpose of an event, and find events. For example, if you are managing a calendar system for a university campus, your event types might include athletic events, invited speaker events, and so on. This topic guides you in&#160;defining new&#160;event types, editing event types, deleting event types, and&#160;activating and&#160;de-activating event types.</p>
        <h2>Create New Event Types</h2>

            <p>Rather than creating an event type from scratch, if you are an EMS customer, then you can import your EMS event types directly into Master Calendar. <strong>See Also:&#160;</strong><a title="Managing Data Sources" href="ConnectDataSources.html" alt="Managing Data Sources">Importing Data Sources from EMS</a>.</p>
