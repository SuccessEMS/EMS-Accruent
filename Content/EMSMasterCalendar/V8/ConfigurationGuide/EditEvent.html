        <h1>Edit an Event</h1>
        <p>From the <a title="Managing an Event from the Event Summary Page" href="ManageEvents.html" alt="Managing an Event from the Event Summary Page">Event Summary page</a>, you can use the <strong>Edit Event</strong> option&#160;or&#160;the <strong>Edit </strong>option. The information you can edit is different for these two options. Also, you must consider whether you are editing a single date event, or a multi-date event.</p>
        <p>This topic will provide the information that will allow you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <MadCap:xref href="#editSingleeventdate">Edit a Single Date Event</MadCap:xref>
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:xref href="#EditMultidateEvent">Edit a Multi-date Event</MadCap:xref>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="editSingleeventdate"></a>Edit a Single Date Event</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the <strong>Edit Event</strong> option to&#160;edit the general information for the event,&#160;add an image to the event, edit additional information for the event, and edit attachments.</li>
            <li>Select the <strong>event date</strong> on any of the three tabs (<strong>All, Current, </strong>or <strong>Historical</strong>) and then click <strong>Edit</strong>, to edit general information for the event, including canceling the event, add an image to the event, change event times, and&#160;edit the custom fields.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="EditMultidateEvent"></a>Edit a Multi-Date Event</h2>
        <p>You can edit either the “top-level” event information (the main event), or you can edit individual dates for the event (the event occurrences).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you edit the main event option, the same edits are applied to all the event occurrences. </li>
            <li>When you edit an event occurrence, the edits are applicable only for the selected occurrence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No other event occurrences are affected. Further, any edits that you make to an event occurrence override the edits that you make to the main event. For example, if you attach an image at the main event level, then this image is displayed for all event occurrences; however, you can also attach a unique image for each occurrence of a multi-date event. If you attach a unique image at the event occurrence level, this image overrides any image that is attached at the main event level.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>At the main event level, you must select the <strong>Edit Event</strong> option. You can change&#160;general information for the main event, add an image to the main event, edit additional information for the main event, and edit attachments for the main event.</li>
            <li>At the&#160;event occurrence level, you must select the <strong>event date</strong> on any of the three tabs (<strong>All</strong>, <strong>Current</strong>, or <strong>Historical</strong>), and then click <strong>Edit </strong>to&#160;edit general information for the event occurrence, including canceling the occurrence. You can also add an image to the event occurrence, edit event times for the occurrence, and edit custom fields for the event occurrence.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If an event that you are editing was imported into Master Calendar from EMS, any information that was originally entered for the event in EMS is not available for editing. Only the information that was entered for the event in Master Calendar (event description, custom fields, and so on) is available for editing. If you need to edit information for the event that was originally entered in EMS, you must edit this information in EMS, and then re-import the event into Master Calendar from EMS.</p>
