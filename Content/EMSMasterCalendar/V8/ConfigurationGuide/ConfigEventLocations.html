        <h1>Configure Event Locations</h1>
        <p class="Body">An <em>event location</em> is the location where the event is to take place. For example, if you are managing a calendar for a university’s athletic events, you could set up a list of possible locations for the event, such as the stadium, the field house, the sports arena, the gymnasium, and so on. When you set up a location in Master Calendar, you can also provide a hyperlink for the location. For example, if you are managing a university’s athletic calendar, and you add the football stadium as a location, you can include a URL for&#160;a webpage showing a map of the stadium. The Location field for an event can be optional or required, depending upon your Master Calendar parameter settings. This topic guides you in setting up new&#160;event locations, activating and de-activating event locations, editing event locations, and deleting event locations.</p>
