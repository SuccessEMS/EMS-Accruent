        <h1>Cancel Event Dates</h1>
        <p>You can cancel all dates for an event in a single step, or you can cancel dates on an individual&#160;basis. When you cancel an event, the event is no longer active in Master Calendar; however,&#160;the entry is not removed from the Manage Events page or the Event Summary page. On the&#160;Event Summary page, and on the event’s calendar, a single line appears through each event&#160;date that was canceled. If you cancel all the dates for an event, then a single line also runs&#160;through the event on the Manage Events page.</p>
        <p>This topic will provide information that will allow you to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#Cancelall">Cancel All Event Dates At Once</a>
