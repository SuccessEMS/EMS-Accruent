        <p>You can generate a Manage Events List report, which lists all the events to which you have&#160;access as a Master Calendar manager. You can generate a report that lists all the pending&#160;events for all calendars to which you have access as a Master Calendar manager or you can&#160;generate a report for events with different statuses.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>

When this page first opens, the list of events that appears is a list of all pending events for all calendars to which you have access as a&#160;Master Calendar manager.</p>
