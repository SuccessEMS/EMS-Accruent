        <p>You use the Request Event Info option on the Manage Events page to request information&#160;from the EMS Contact for a selected event that has been pulled into Master Calendar from an&#160;EMS database.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the&#160;Manage Events page, filter&#160;for the pending events that you are approving.&#160;</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the EMS tab.&#160;This tab shows all the events that have been pulled from an EMS database into Master Calendar via a connector.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Select the event or events for which you need more information from the EMS Contact,&#160;and then under Actions, click Request Event Info.&#160;The Request Event Info dialog box opens. </p>

            <li>Enter any questions that you would like to request of the EMS Contact, and then click&#160;<span class="ui">Send</span>.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="ui">OK </span>in the prompt about sending an email to request more information.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="ui">OK </span>in the confirmation message.&#160;The email is sent to the EMS Contact for the selected event. The email contains a "<span class="ui">Fill out&#160;more info</span>" link that the EMS Contact can click to open an Additional Info page on which they can enter or edit the requested information and&#160;then submit the information. This action essentially allows the EMS contact to work&#160;directly with the event in Master Calendar and prevents you from having to manually&#160;enter the information that you have requested from the EMS contact.</p>

            <p>Depending on how your site administrator has configured Master Calendar, after the EMS Contact modifies the information for the&#160;event, the event request might be set to a Pending status. An automated email would then be&#160;generated and sent to the Calendar Manager informing the manager of the&#160;modifications by the contact and the status change to “Pending” for the event. </p>
