        <h2><a name="understandingusertypes"></a>Understanding User Types</h2>
        <p>There are two different user types in <MadCap:variable name="General.Product" />:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="ui">Administrators</span>: These expert users create and maintain the EMS application within your organization, and manage or approve usage of space. Administrators include conference center managers, event coordinators, registrars, facility and real estate managers, and service providers. They can use this tool to set up and control the booking process and booking templates, define space (buildings, rooms, floors, areas, and regions), define services, manage security and user permissions, grant access, initiate notifications and reports, and integrate with other applications, servers, databases, and systems. Administrators can include Service Providers (Catering, Audio Visual, IT Support Staff), Security, and Receptionist Staff. These users will primarily use the EMS Desktop Client.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Everyday Users</span>: This is a majority of the users in the organization. Everyday Users, such as an employee who needs to book a conference room or a consultant who needs to book a hoteling space for the day, can use it to make reservations and book meetings. Everyday Users are typically requesting rooms and services. These users do not use the <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Desktop Client" />, they will primarily use the web based application, EMS Web App in V44.1 (referred to as VEMS&#160;if using V44).</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="EverydayUserRes"></a>Everyday User Reservations</h2>
        <p>An Everyday User Reservation is any reservation that a user has submitted through EMS Web App.</p>
        <p>The everyday user reservation searching tool in the EMS Desktop Client is identical to the Browser searching tool with one exception: when the Browser opens for the first time, the Browse for function is set to Reservations whereas the Everyday User Reservation tool is set to Everyday User Reservations. As a result, although this section is written from the perspective of using the Browser, all the information can be applied when using the Everyday User Reservation searching tool.</p>
        <p>To open this tool in EMS Desktop Client, click the Everyday User Reservations icon on the EMS toolbar.</p>
        <h2><a name="EMSSystemArchitecture"></a>EMS System Architecture</h2>
        <p>The EMS Desktop Client is the foundation for a broad range of components, services, web applications, APIs, add-ons, and integrations.</p>

        </p>
        <h2><a name="Upgrading"></a>Upgrading</h2>
        <p>If you are upgrading to a newer version of EMS, please encourage users at your facility to read the release notes before they begin working with the new version of the software. Doing so will minimize the amount of time it takes them to get “up-to-speed” with the new release and help them benefit from new features and functions that they might not otherwise discover.</p>
        <div class="ImportantNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #990000;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Important! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p> All the EMS-related components you have licensed must be upgraded with this release.</p>
        </div>
        <h2><a name="productreg"></a>Product Registration</h2>
        <p>Primary Contacts can obtain the license file from the Support Center area on www.emssoftware.com.  This license file is required to activate your EMS software and is required for new and existing customers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Configuration</li>
            <li>System Administration</li>
