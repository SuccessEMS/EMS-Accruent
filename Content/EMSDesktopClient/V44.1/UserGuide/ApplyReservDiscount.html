            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />You use the Apply Reservation Discount Wizard to&#160;apply&#160;a reservation discount to&#160;non-invoiced&#160;details in a booking. The discount is applied as a percentage of the total charge for an item and it is added to any existing discounts that have already been applied to the item.</p>
