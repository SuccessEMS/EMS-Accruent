        <p>The Reconfirm Dates tab displays reservations that have been booked in a status that requires the Reconfirm Date option (for example, a Tentative or Hold status). The list of reservations is automatically sorted in ascending order by Reconfirm Date. You use this tab as a reminder to reconfirm such reservations.</p>
