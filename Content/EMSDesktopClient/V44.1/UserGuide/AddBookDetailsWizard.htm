            <li>
                <p>Focus the Navigator on the booking within that reservation for which you want to add services, equipment, etc., and click the&#160;Tools&#160;button, then select&#160;Add Booking Details Wizard (your Administrator might have re-labeled this option; if it does appear, services are not allowed for this type of booking).&#160;</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add a Service order:&#160;In the Add Booking Details popup window that presents, select a category of service or equipment you want to add. The fields on the right panel change depending on the selection you make.&#160;</p>
                <p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you have completed the fields in the right panel, click the&#160;Next&#160;button. EMS Desktop Client advances you through the information you must enter to complete the service order. Tabs and fields that display to you vary depending on how the type of service is configured for your organization. The example below shows a catering service order that is defined to allow you to add menu items; two have been added to the right panel which indicates menu items to be included with the order (in this case, for 5 servings). The same type of window displays for other types of services such as equipment; the only difference is that the items might be human activities such as setup, teardown, opening windows, turning on lights, and so on.</p>

                    <p>You can add notes and other details to each menu item by selecting it and clicking the&#160;<span class="ui">Edit&#160;</span>button. Click&#160;<span class="ui">OK&#160;</span>to save such changes.</p>

                    <p>If a cost is associated with an item, cost related fields will appear similar to those shown above; if you are authorized, you can change them (for example, to apply a discount).

        <p>Once a service order has been added to a booking and you click to expand the order in the left panel, information in both the upper and lower right panel changes to show detail about that specific service order. The following four tabs show in the Navigator in the upper right panel:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>User Defined Fields tab—The User Defined Fields tab displays the additional fields that store custom data for the booking detail. Your EMS administrator configures the types of fields that are available as well as the allowed values for these fields. See&#160;<a href="UserDefFieldsinNav.html" title="Working with User Defined Fields in the Navigator" alt="Working with User Defined Fields in the Navigator">Working with User Defined Fields in the Navigator</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reminders tab—The Reminders tab displays any reminders that were created for the selected booking detail.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Comments tab—The Comments tab displays any comments that were made for the selected booking detail.</p>
            </li>

                <p>                See <a href="CommRemindinNav.html" title="Working with Comments and Reminders in the Navigator" alt="Working with Comments and Reminders in the Navigator">Working with Comments and Reminders in the Navigator</a>.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>History tab—The History tab displays the history for the booking detail (the date that a change was made to the detail, the ID of the user who made the change, the field that was changed, the old field value, and the new field value).</p>
                <p>

                    </img>
                </p>
                <p>Also, service order items for the selected booking detail show in the Items pane in the lower right panel. A green check mark appears in front of each individual item that has been added to a booking. If the item is a package, then a green checkmark is displayed not only in front of the package, but also, in front of each individual item in the package. A red "<span style="color: #ff0000;">X</span>" is displayed in front of any booking detail and/or booking detail item that has been deleted from a booking.&#160;</p>
                <p>If you click on&#160;a booking details item in the left pane of the Navigator, then the entire right pane of the Navigator is refreshed with three tabs: a Properties tab that displays for the selected item, a Selections tab that displays the selections for the booking detail item (if applicable), and a History tab that details the history of the item.</p>
