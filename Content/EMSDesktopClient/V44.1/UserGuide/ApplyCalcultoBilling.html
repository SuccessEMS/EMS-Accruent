        <p>Calculations&#160;are additional charges that can be applied to billable items based on an associated group or individual, a category or service, or a room.</p>
        <p>... such as gratuity or sales tax. Both pricing methods and calculations determine the final cost for a billable item; however, unlike pricing, which is applied when a billable item is reserved (and retained, even if the price for the item later changes), calculations are figured each time a confirmation or an invoice is generated. If an event has associated calculations (which are assigned to groups or individuals, categories and services, and rooms), you will see these in the&#160;invoicing process.&#160;</p>
