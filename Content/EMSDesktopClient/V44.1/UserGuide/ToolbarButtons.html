            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Toolbar Buttons</h1>
        <p>The toolbar always displays buttons for Book, Calendar, Wizard, Navigator, Browser, Everyday User Reservations, Groups, Email, Dashboard, and Manage Services. Other buttons for other functions might also display, depending on the version of EMS that you are running (such as EMS Campus or EMS Workplace) and additional components your organization&#160;might have installed, such as EMS Glance or the EMS Polycom Interface. Some of the functions that are available on the toolbar are also available from the main menu. You can&#160;customize&#160;the appearance of this toolbar to best suit your business needs; keep in mind that your System Administrator might have re-labeled these options with different names than the examples shown in this topic.</p>
