            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Send Emails</h1>
        <p>Once your EMS Desktop Client Administrator has configured system email for EMS Desktop Client, you can set personal preferences on your installation of the application to email confirmations or invoices to groups or miscellaneous information to your EMS users or groups. </p>
        <p>Your personal preferences on your installation of the EMS Desktop Client control how emails are sent:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>If your organization uses Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Outlook, you can set preferences to use your respective email system within EMS Desktop Client to send confirmations and invoices or any other individual emails to EMS users or groups.</li>
            <li>To send bulk emails to groups within EMS Desktop Client (basic/advanced, transactions, calendar, and so on), however, you must set preferences to use SMTP email.</li>
            <li>If your organization does not use Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Outlook, furthermore, SMTP email is also used to send all email from EMS Desktop Client, including emails to users or groups and confirmations and invoices.</li>
            <li>Generic emails (which are not “tied” to a confirmation, invoice, reminder, etc.) can go to any recipient.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>For any of your personal email preferences to work, your user account must be configured with an email address. See your EMS administrator or internal IT staff for information on how to enable SMTP email.</p>
