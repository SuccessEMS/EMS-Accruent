            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Create a Reservation in the Reservation Wizard</h1>
        <p>You use the Reservation Wizard to check for available space for an event and to make a reservation for the event.</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Concept:&#160;Reservations are containers for multiple bookings; bookings are individual meetings <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Click_to_Expand.flsnp" /></MadCap:dropDownHotspot>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>When you "make a reservation" in EMS, you are creating the broader rules for events that take place with a similar purpose and involving most of the same people, services, resources,&#160;and spaces. When you "book" a meeting, you are creating a meeting within a reservation.&#160;See Also:&#160;<a href="ReservandBookings.html" title="Reservation Structure" alt="Reservation Structure">Reservation Structure</a>.</p>
                <p>The Reservation Wizard helps you search for rooms that are available for a particular time on one day (a simple reservation with one booking) or on multiple days (a series reservation with multiple bookings). You can also create a series reservation by selecting one date and time, but multiple rooms.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <p>To make a reservation using the Reservation Wizard, you will:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>Set the event date, time, and status.&#160;</li>
            <li>Set the event location.&#160;</li>
            <li>Set the event information.&#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>The following procedure describes how to make a reservation by selecting values for the required and optional fields.</p>
        </div>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>If your EMS administrator has configured reservation wizard templates, then a Reservation Wizard Template drop-down list is displayed at the top of the Reservation Wizard. You can streamline the booking process by&#160;choosing from these&#160;templates, which automatically sets the default values for many of the fields in the Reservation Wizard.</li>
            <li>If your job entails making multiple reservations that require the same information, and you are not using reservation wizard templates, then you can set your own default values for many of the fields in the Reservation Wizard. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Set&#160;the Event Date and Time</h2>
        <ol start="1" class="number-list">
            <li>On the toolbar, click the Wizard icon. The Reservation Wizard opens. All required fields in the wizard are marked with a red dot. Your EMS administrator configures the required fields.</li>

        <ol start="2" class="number-list">
            <li>If needed, use the scroll features on the top of the Calendar to open the calendar for a different month (&lt; or &gt;) or for a different year (&lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt;). You can also click a month at the top of the calendar to open a drop-down list from which you can select a different month and you can also click a year at the top of the calendar to open a drop-down list from which you can select a different year.</li>
            <li>
                <p>If the event dates do&#160;not&#160;follow a pattern, use one or more of the following options for entering a date; otherwise, go to the next step.&#160;Click to pick dates on the calendar.&#160;To select all five days in a work week, click in the blank space to the left of the week.&#160;To select all seven days in a week, double-click in the blank space to the left of the week.</p>

                </p>
                <p>To select every occurrence of a specific day of the week for the displayed month (for example, all Tuesdays in November, 2012), click the heading (S, M, T, and so on) for the day.&#160;To select every occurrence of a specific day of the week shown&#160;(regardless if the day falls within the same month), double-click the heading (S, M, T, and so on) for the day. If you need to clear a single selected date, click the date again. To clear multiple selected dates in a single step, click&#160;Clear Month&#160;to clear all currently selected dates for the currently displayed month or click&#160;Clear All&#160;to clear all currently selected dates regardless of month or year.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>If the event dates do follow a recurrent pattern, (for example, the third Friday of every month), click&#160;Date Pattern&#160;to open the Date Pattern dialog box and enter your event date information. The steps that you use to create a date pattern in EMS are very similar to the steps that you use to create a date pattern in Microsoft Outlook or in any other calendaring product.</p>

                        <p>As you specify the event dates, the Selected Dates tab is automatically updated with the selected dates.&#160;Dates that are closed are displayed in red on the Calendar tab, holidays are green. These&#160;are linked to information about the closure (in the Selected Dates tab, click&#160;Holidays). To remove the date your selection, open the Selected Dates tab, select the date, or CTRL-click to select multiple dates, and then click&#160;Remove. When you make a reservation for multiple dates, the process is easier if you first remove all holidays or closed dates from the list of selected dates; however, be very careful when selecting dates for removal as you are not prompted to confirm your selection before you click&#160;Remove.</p>

                    <li>Manually enter the time in each field. When you manually enter the time, you can use a shortcut. For example, for 9:00 am, you need to enter only “9a” and for 2:00 pm, you need to enter only “2p,” and so on. If you enter an end time that is earlier than the start time, then the system assumes that the end time is the next day and the phrase “Next Day” is displayed to the right of the End time field.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Specify Setup and Teardown times.&#160;To use the default setup and teardown times that your EMS administrator has assigned to the rooms in your system, leave&#160;Use Default&#160;selected.&#160;To override the default setup/teardown times, clear&#160;Use Default, select&#160;Minutes or Hours, and then enter your own setup and teardown times. Remember, setup and teardown times are the hours, or fractions of hours, that you add to the event time to allow staff to prepare a room for the event or to clean up after the event. For example, for a 30 minute setup time, you can enter 30 minutes or 0.5 hours.</li>
            <li>Select the status&#160;for the event. Depending on the status that you select, for example, Tentative or Hold, you might be required to enter a reconfirm date. You can monitor reservations that must be reconfirmed on the Reconfirm Dates tab on the EMS Dashboard.

                        <p>The&#160;Available&#160;tab, which is the active tab and is always displayed, has two lists. The list in the left pane is a list of all the rooms that meet&#160;some or all&#160;of your event criteria. The list in the right pane is a list of all the event dates that must be fulfilled. By default, the available rooms are sorted alphabetically by room code. If your EMS administrator has configured the rooms for your EMS implementation with a book sequence, then under Options, select Sort Rooms by Book Sequence to sort the rooms from lowest to highest book sequence. (If two rooms have the same sequence, then the rooms are sorted alphabetically by name within the sequence.)</p>

Optionally, you can open the Conflicts tab to view the list of rooms that were not available for scheduling for the event as well as list of the events that are scheduled for each room.</p>

        <h3>Find a Specific Room</h3>
        <p>You can use the specific room search to book a standard EMS room or a room or area that is not managed in EMS. An&#160;override room, or “override description,” is used to book an event in a space that has not been configured in your EMS system. For example, your EMS administrator might have configured an override room named “Other Area” in the Engineering building. To book an event in Dr. Wilson's office, which is a room that is not defined in EMS, in the Engineering building, you can select the “Other Area” room and specify “Dr. Wilson's Office” for the location. EMS does not track availability for events booked in override rooms; however, EMS reports on events that are scheduled in an override room just like any other event scheduled for any other room.</p>

            <p>A reservation is not complete and rooms are not removed from the Available list until you click&#160;Finish.
