                <p>Your Administrator can automate alerts&#160;to be sent to you (or groups of which you are a member) when changes or additions have been made in EMS for bookings and reservations,&#160;service orders, room types,&#160;setup types,&#160;user accounts, and so on. When you create a reservation or booking that has these&#160;notifications turned on, users will receive these alerts without requiring additional effort from you. Be sure to review these notification settings during the process of creating or modifying events.&#160;</p>
