        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />When you edit a booking in the Navigator, you are working with the&#160;when&#160;and&#160;where&#160;information for the event: the event time, the event location, and so on. To edit a booking, you must have the appropriate security access. For example, you cannot move a booking to a room if your EMS administrator has not granted you access to the room. Likewise, you cannot change the status for a booking from Tentative to Confirmed if your EMS administrator has not granted you access to the Confirmed status. If you cannot change a booking and you have appropriate permissions, it might be&#160;<a href="WhyBookingLocked.html" MadCap:conditions="General.Online Only">locked</a><a href="https://docs.emssoftware.com/Content/EMSDesktopClient/V44.1/UserGuide/WhyBookingLocked.html" MadCap:conditions="General.Print Only">locked</a>.&#160;</p>
