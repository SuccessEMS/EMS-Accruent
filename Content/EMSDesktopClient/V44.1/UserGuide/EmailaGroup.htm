        <p>Whether your organization uses Microsoft Outlook or SMTP, you can always email an EMS group.</p>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>If your organization uses Microsoft Outlook, you can continue to use this email system to send emails to EMS groups; otherwise, to email an EMS group using the SMTP option, your user account must have an email address.</p>
        </div>
        <p>To email a group, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Search for the group that you are emailing. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Do one of the following:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>On the Groups window, select the group and then click Email. Depending on how your system is configured, either a pre-addressed Outlook email form or a pre-addressed SMTP email form opens. The To field is populated with the email address that is defined for the group, but you can edit this value if needed. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>On the Groups window, select the group, and then click Open.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The group-specific window opens. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the group-specific window, make sure that the group is selected in the left pane, and then click Email. Depending on how your system is configured, either a pre-addressed Outlook email form or a pre-addressed SMTP email form opens. The To field is populated with the email address that is defined for the group, but you can edit this value if needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Complete and send the email as you normally would.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </body>
