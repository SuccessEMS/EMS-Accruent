        <p>You use the Delete Booking Details Wizard to&#160;delete&#160;one or more booking details that do&#160;not&#160;have invoiced items from multiple bookings in a single step. When you delete a booking detail from a booking, any items that have been added for the detail are also deleted.</p>

        <ol start="1" class="number-list">
