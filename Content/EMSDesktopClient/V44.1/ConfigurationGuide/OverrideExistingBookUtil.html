            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Override Existing Bookings Utility</h1>
        <p>In some situations, such as a building closure, a scheduled maintenance repair, a priority event, and so on, you might need to “bump” one or more bookings from their scheduled location. You&#160;use&#160;the Override Existing Bookings Utility to bump all the bookings that meet specific criteria and place them in a Conflict status. A new all day booking that uses the settings (Event Name, Event Type, and Group) that you specify is created in place of these bumped bookings.</p>
        <p>To override existing bookings using the utility, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="number-list">
            <li>
                <p>On the EMS menu bar, click <span class="ui">System Administration</span> &gt; <span class="ui">Tools </span>&gt; <span class="ui">Override Existing Bookings Utility</span>. The Override Existing Bookings Utility window opens.</p>
                <div class="TitleandImage">

            <li>
                <p>Do the following to search for the rooms that contain the bookings that you are bumping. A list of all the rooms configured for the selected building, area, or view and that are of the indicated Room Type will display on the Available list.</p>
                <ul start="2">
                    <li>

            <li>
                <p>Repeat&#160;Step 2&#160;and&#160;Step 3&#160;until you have selected all the rooms that contain the bookings that you are bumping.</p>

            <li>
