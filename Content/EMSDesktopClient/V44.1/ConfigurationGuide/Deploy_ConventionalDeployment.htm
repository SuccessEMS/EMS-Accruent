            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />What is Conventional Deployment?&#160;</h2>
        <p>The conventional deployment method is delivered in a typical MSI file. This file can be run directly on a computer, or installed via an administrative push. Standard toolsets for working with MSI files can be used for deployment. If your organization already has polices and systems in place for pushing applications, this might be the preferred way to deploy the EMS&#160;Desktop Client. If you are looking for an easier way to deploy the EMS&#160;Desktop Client, see&#160;<a href="Deploy_Web Deployment.htm" title="EMS_V44.1/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/EMS_Desktop_Client_Deployment_Options/To_Use_EMS_Desktop_Client_Web_Deployment" alt="EMS_V44.1/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/EMS_Desktop_Client_Deployment_Options/To_Use_EMS_Desktop_Client_Web_Deployment">Understand EMS Desktop Client Web Deployment&#160;</a>.</p>
