            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />How Do I Configure EMS for Meeting Requests and Approvals (Managed Space)?</h1>
        <p>To configure functionality so that users can request space and so that those requests require approval, you will:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>Identify space (rooms, buildings, facilities, services, etc.) you want to push through a Request &gt; Approval process.</li>
            <li>Determine who can make these requests and who can approve them.</li>
            <li>Define special process templates for this type of booking and associate them with managed space.</li>
            <li>Assign these templates to users or types of users who should only be able to request managed space.</li>
            <li>Guide approvers to use the <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Desktop Client" /> Dashboard to review and approve the requests.</li>
        </ul>
