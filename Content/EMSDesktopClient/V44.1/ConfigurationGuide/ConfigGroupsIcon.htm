        <p>Groups is an icon on the application toolbar. The label "Groups"&#160;is generic and is the default label delivered with EMS Desktop Client. The Groups label is often re-labeled "Employees" or "Customers." Groups can be associated with Billing and PO numbers, booking templates, and so on, and greatly affect what your end-users have access to during the booking process.</p>
