        <h1>Configure Features</h1>
        <p>A <span class="ui">feature</span> is built-in or permanent attribute of a room, such as a network connection, a&#160;built-in plasma TV, window, and so on. Your users can use features as criteria when they are searching for a room. They can also filter the available rooms that can be reserved for an event by room features. After you configure&#160;different room features for your organization, you must indicate which rooms have these features.</p>
