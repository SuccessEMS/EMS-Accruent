        <h1>Configure Attachment Types</h1>
        <p>The term&#160;attachment&#160;is used to describe any file that you can add to or store&#160;on a reservation or booking. (Unlike a drawing, which is simply referenced, an attachment is actually stored in the EMS database with the reservation or booking record.) Attachments can be used for a variety of purposes, such as providing information about your company’s alcohol policies, any special food concerns for the event’s attendees, and so on. You can&#160;configure&#160;and store a variety of attachment types and then your users can select whichever type is most appropriate when working with attachments for a reservation or booking.</p>
        <p>An attachment can also be a file that is saved with the room record or a group record. You do not specify an attachment type for a room record. For information about adding an attachment to a room record, see&#160;To add attachments to a room.&#160;For information about adding an attachment to a group, see the <a href="../UserGuide/DesktopClient_UG.html">EMS Desktop Client User Guide</a>.</p>
        <p>To configure an&#160;attachment type, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="number-list">
            <li>
                <p>On the EMS menu bar, click <span class="ui">Configuration </span>&gt; <span class="ui">Other </span>&gt; <span class="ui">Attachment Type</span>. The Attachment Types window opens. This window lists all the attachment types that are currently configured in your EMS database and that have a status of <span class="ui">Active</span>.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>By default, an attachment type is added as an active type. Select <span class="ui">Inactive </span>to inactivate the attachment type.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="ui">OK</span>. The Attachment Type dialog box closes. You return to the Attachment Types window with the newly added attachment type automatically selected.</p>
