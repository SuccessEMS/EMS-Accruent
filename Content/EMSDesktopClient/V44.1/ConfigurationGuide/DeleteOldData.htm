            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Delete Old Data</h1>
        <p>As the EMS administrator, you can&#160;delete&#160;bookings, historical data, email history, holidays, building hours, notifications, and if applicable, EMS Kiosk transactions that occur on or before a specific date. You can also&#160;delete&#160;unused groups, contacts and web users (groups, contacts, and web users who have no associated records in your EMS database). If you delete all the bookings for a reservation, the reservation is also deleted from the EMS database. As a safeguard, it is a system requirement that the date that you specify for bookings, historical data, email history, holidays, building hours, or notifications be at least three months prior to the current day’s date.</p>
        <p>Before using the Delete Old Data utility, make a backup of your EMS database. Deletion of data using this utility is a permanent deletion and you can recover the data only by using a backup copy of your EMS database.</p>
