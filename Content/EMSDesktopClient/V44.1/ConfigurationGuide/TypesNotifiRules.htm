        <h2><a name="Booking"></a>Booking Notification Rules</h2>
        <p>Any of the following notification types are considered booking notifications and are available when creating new Notification Rules in the wizard:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>New Bookings</li>
            <li>Changes to Date/Time</li>
            <li>Room Changes</li>
            <li>Status Changes</li>
        </ul>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>The Setup Type field in the Notification Rule Wizard enables you to ensure that changes to a booking's room setup will appropriately notify attendees. You can select one of the existing setup types, or one of the options below.<ul><li>(all) - The rule will trigger on all Setup Types.</li><li>(any other than Room default) - Notifications will trigger for all Setup Types except for the Room's default Setup Type. (To change the default Setup Type you can go to Configuration &gt; Facilities &gt; Rooms, then select a Room and click Edit; then make your changes in the "Default Setup Type" field.)</li></ul></li>
            <li>Next to the Notification triggers if change occurs within... field, you can specify the timeframe (in days or hours) leading up to the booking when notifications generate. Enter a number and select "Days" or "Hours" from the drop-down list.</li>
            <li>The Display New Booking As field enables you to specify whether the Notification occurs as Booking Information or Reservation Information. For example, for new reservations that contain multiple bookings (recurring meetings), if Booking Information is selected, then a Notification occurs for every individual booking. If Reservation Information is selected, then a single Notification occurs for the entire reservation.</li>
            <li>For Source, indicate whether additions and/or changes in the EMS Desktop Client, EMS Web App, or both will trigger a Notification.</li>
        </ol>
