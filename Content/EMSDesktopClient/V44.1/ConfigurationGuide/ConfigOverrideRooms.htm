        <h1>Configure Override Rooms</h1>
        <p>An&#160;<span class="ui">override&#160;room</span>&#160;is used in&#160;EMS&#160;to loosely define useable space which is not formally configured. </p>
        <p>For example, a building can have private&#160;offices which are not configured as spaces available for public use, but you might need to select such a space for an attendee who is participating remotely in a video conference. In order to provide company employees the ability to schedule meetings in these&#160;private&#160;rooms, Override Rooms can be configured in&#160;EMS.<span class="ui"> See Also:&#160;</span><a href="ConfigBuilding.html#Specify">Specify Unregistered Attendee/Visitor&#160;Behavior</a>.</p>
        <h2>Create an Override Room</h2>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>On the <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Desktop Client" /> menu bar, click <span class="ui">Configuration </span>&gt; <span class="ui">Facilities </span>&gt; <strong>Rooms</strong>.&#160;The Rooms Configuration page opens.</li>
            <li>Click New.</li>
            <li>In the Room Name field, enter a name for the space in a way that indicates an Override&#160;Room&#160;(for example, "Override&#160;Area 1”).</li>
            <li>Under Classification, select "Override Description"&#160;from the dropdown. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In the example above, "Override&#160;Area&#160;1” can be used repeatedly to serve as a placeholder for any meeting request which will occur in an un-configured space.</p>
        <p>For example, on Monday a user makes a&#160;reservation&#160;for "Override&#160;Area&#160;1” and names it "Meeting in Mike Thompson’s Office”, and on Wednesday another user makes a&#160;reservation&#160;for "Override&#160;Area&#160;1” and names it "Meet Guests in&#160;Lobby Reception&#160;Area&#160;Prior to Building Tour.”</p>
        <p>EMS&#160;does not track availability for events booked in Override Rooms; however,&#160;EMS&#160;reports on events that are scheduled in an override&#160;room&#160;as it would for an&#160;event scheduled for any other&#160;room.</p>
