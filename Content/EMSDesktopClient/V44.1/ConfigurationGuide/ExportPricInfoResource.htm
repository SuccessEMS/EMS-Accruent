        <p>You can&#160;export&#160;any pricing information that you have configured for a resource on a per rate schedule basis from the Edit Pricing window. The information is exported to a Microsoft Excel file.</p>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>You do not need Microsoft Excel on your EMS client to export the information to the file; however, you must have Microsoft Excel on your EMS client to view the file. You can also export the pricing information for rooms and billable items after you have configured the information for the room or resource. See&#160;also: <a href="ExportPricInfoRoom.htm">Export Pricing Information for a Room</a> and&#160;<a href="ExportPricingInfoBillableItems.htm">Export Pricing Information for Billable Items</a>.</p>
