        <h1>Notifications Automatically Alert People to Changes in <MadCap:variable name="General.Product" /></h1>
        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.Product" />, changing events can automatically notify users. Your Administrator can automate alerts to be sent to you (or groups of which you are a member) when changes or additions have been made in <MadCap:variable name="General.Product" /> for bookings and reservations, service orders, room types, setup types, user accounts, and so on. When you create a reservation or booking that has these notifications turned on, users will receive these alerts without requiring additional effort from you. Be sure to review these notification settings during the process of creating or modifying events.</p>
        <p>If your <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Web App" /> implementation uses the <a href="WebApp_IntegrationwithExchangeEnables.html">Integration with Exchange</a>, you can handle notifications using Outlook<sup>®</sup>.</p>
