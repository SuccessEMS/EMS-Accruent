        <p>The EMS Web App automatically sends out notifications based on the filters on the notification rule.</p>
        <p>There are five types of notification rules:</p>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>Bookings</li>
            <li>Service Orders</li>
            <li>Anything on a VIP&#160;Event</li>
            <li>New Web Users</li>
            <li>User-Defined Fields</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are mostly sent out a predefined amount of days prior to a booking.  They are triggered when a change occurs on a booking, service order, etc., within that range of days.</p>
        <h2>Confirmations</h2>
        <p>Confirmations are either sent out automatically after a booking is made in EMS Web App, or manually from the EMS Desktop Client.</p>
        <p>Confirmations contain the date/time/resources for the booking that was created. These usually go to end users so they know when their event is and if they owe any money.</p>
        <h2>Notifications for Event Changes</h2>
        <p>Your Administrator can automate alerts to be sent to you (or groups of which you are a member) when changes or additions have been made in EMS for bookings and reservations, service orders, room types, setup types, user accounts, and so on. When you create a reservation or booking that has these notifications turned on, users will receive these alerts without requiring additional effort from you. Review these notification settings during the process of creating or modifying events.</p>
        <p>If your EMS Web App implementation uses the Integration with Exchange, you can handle notifications using Outlook.</p>
        <h2>Integration to Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Exchange Enables You to Use Outlook<sup>®</sup></h2>
        <p>If your organization deploys our Integration to Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Exchange, you can view the availability of meeting rooms and attendees, and send Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Outlook<sup>®</sup> meeting invitations, all from within EMS Web App.</p>
        <p>You must be licensed for EMS Desktop Client, EMS Web App, and Integration to Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Exchange in order to configure and use this capability. If you are unsure if your organization is licensed for Integration to Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Exchange, or if you would like to learn more about it, please contact your EMS Account Executive.</p>
