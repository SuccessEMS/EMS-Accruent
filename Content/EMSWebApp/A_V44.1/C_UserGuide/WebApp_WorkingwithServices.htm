        <h2><a name="Services_Categories_and_Resources"></a>Services, Categories, and Resources</h2>
        <p>In EMS, you may sometimes hear the terms Services, Categories, and Resources used interchangeably; however, they are different concepts.</p>
        <h3>Categories</h3>
        <p>A Category in EMS is anything you might add to a Booking such as Catering, Audio Visual, Furniture, Security, Notes, Attendee Names, Agendas etc. When you configure a Category, however, it must be of six Category types: Activities, Attendees, Catering, Notes, Resources with Service Orders, or Resources Without Service Orders. These types cause the service to behave slightly differently when added to a booking. For example, a Notes/Activities/Attendees type service category does not require the EMS Administrator to configure items under it and there is nothing for a person to “select” from these types of services.</p>
        <h3>Service Category</h3>
        <p>By contrast, a service category that has a type of Catering, Resource with Service Order, or a Resource without a Service Order Category, will require the Administrator to create items under it. For example, an "AV Equipment" service  category (configured as a Resource without a Service Order Category type) might have items under it such as a flip chart or whiteboard (under AV Equipment). The person requesting the service for this meeting would then select <span class="ui">AV equipment</span>; then flipchart and whiteboard would be typical options to add to the event.</p>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>The following Category Types allow <a href="../../../EMSDesktopClient/V44.1/ConfigurationGuide/DefineProdAreaItems.htm">Production Items</a>: Catering, Resources with Service Orders, and Resources Without Service Orders.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Furthermore, a Category can&#160;be <a href="../../../EMSDesktopClient/V44.1/ConfigurationGuide/ConfigCategory.html">configured&#160;to "Use States"</a>&#160;so that when a service is requested with a meeting, it can be managed through a review and approval process in the Manage Services toolbar option&#160;in EMS Desktop Client.&#160;</p>
