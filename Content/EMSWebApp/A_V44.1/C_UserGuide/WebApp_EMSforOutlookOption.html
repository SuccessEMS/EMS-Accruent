        <h1>EMS for Outlook<sup>®</sup> (Optional Capability)</h1>
        <p>EMS for Outlook<sup>®</sup> is an optional (extra cost) purchase. If your organization has purchased it, then&#160;you will see the EMS plug-in icon in your Outlook application. You will also see additional features and functionality in <MadCap:variable name="General.Product" />. Furthermore, anywhere that you see people or groups in EMS, you will have access to everyone in your organization's email database (which is stored in Exchange Server). This means that you can&#160;see people's availability (Out of Office, Busy, In a Meeting, etc.), send them email invitations or notices, and add <MadCap:variable name="General.Product" /> events to your Outlook calendar.</p>
