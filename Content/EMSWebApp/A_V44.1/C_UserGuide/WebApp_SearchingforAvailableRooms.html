            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Search for Available Rooms</h1>
        <p>During the booking process, you can search for available rooms on the Room Request page in two ways:&#160;<span class="ui">Let Me Search For A Room</span> or <span class="ui">I Know What Room I Want</span>.</p>
        <p>To search for available rooms, do the following:</p>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>From the Create a Reservation screen, in the Bookings area, select one of the following:&#160;<ul class="unorder-list"><li><span class="ui">Let Me Search For A Room</span><p>OR</p></li><li><span class="ui">I Know What Room I Want</span>&#160;</li></ul><p><img src="Images/C_UserGuide/WA_SearchingforAvailableRooms_RoomRequestPage.png" class="hyperlink_with_padding_and_border" /></p><div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><p>Filters in the left panel help you narrow your Room Search Results. When you click <span class="ui">Search</span>, results appear on the right. From these results, you can view expanded Room Details by clicking on the room name, and you can view any available floor plans by clicking the floor plan icon next to it.</p><p>You can click the Add/Remove buttons next to Locations, Floors, Setup Types, and Features to add or expand your filters. To set Favorite Rooms to use every time, see  <a href="WebApp_SettingFavoriteRooms.html">Set Favorite Rooms</a>.</p><p>Locating space as part of the reservation process is different than browsing locations. For detailed instructions on using the BROWSE LOCATIONS option in the main menu to view available and booked space, see <a href="WebApp_BrowsingLocations.html">Browse Locations</a>.</p></div></li>
            <li>To filter your search by Location, click&#160;<span class="ui">Add/Remove</span>&#160;next to <span class="ui">Location</span>. This presents a list of locations by Building or view. Select the locations filters you want to apply (or search by keyword), and then click&#160;<span class="ui">Update Locations</span>. This filters the results of your keyword search on the Add New Favorite Room dialog (above).&#160;Your filter settings are&#160;saved, and you will have to go back in and remove&#160;them if you want to expand search results beyond these locations.<p><img src="Images/C_UserGuide/WA_SearchingforAvailableRooms_UpdateLocations.png" style="width: 436px; height: 423px;" class="padding_only" /></p></li>
            <li>Once you have located a room to reserve, click the&#160;Add&#160;(<span class="ui">+</span>)&#160;icon to add it to your reservation. This adds the booking to your cart. You can change your mind and delete or change the room for the booking before you finalize your reservation.</li>
