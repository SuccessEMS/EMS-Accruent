        <p>When adding IIS using the Add Roles Wizard, only the default installation is executed, which has a minimum set of role services. For EMS products, it is necessary to add role services for the programs to function properly. If role services are added after installing&#160;IIS, the Server Administrator will need to navigate to the Role Services page by following the <a href="WebApp_Install-IIS2008.html">Install Internet Information Services (IIS)</a> directions and then clicking <span class="ui">Next</span>.</p>
        <p>Select the following IIS Role Services to be installed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#Common_HTTP_Features">Common HTTP Features</a>

        <ol start="1" class="number-list">
            <li><span class="ui">Static Content</span>&#160;– Static Content lets the Web server publish static Web file formats, such as HTML pages and image files. Use Static Content to publish files on a Web server that users can then view using a Web browser.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Default Document</span>&#160;– Default Document lets organizations configure a default file for the Web server to return when users do not specify a file in a URL. Default documents make it easier and more convenient for users to reach an organizations Web site.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Directory Browsing</span>&#160;– Directory Browsing lets users see the contents of a directory on a Web server. Use Directory Browsing to enable an automatically generated list of all directories and files available in a directory when users do not specify a file in a URL and default documents are either disabled or not configured.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">HTTP Errors</span>&#160;– HTTP Errors lets organizations customize the error messages returned to users’ browsers when the Web server detects a fault condition. Use HTTP errors to give users a better user experience when they run up against an error message. Consider providing users with an e-mail address for staff who can help them resolve the error.</li>

        <ol start="1" class="number-list">
            <li><span class="ui">ASP.NET</span>&#160;– ASP.NET provides a server side object-oriented programming environment for building Web sites and Web applications that use managed code. ASP.NET is not just a new version of ASP. ASP.NET provides a robust infrastructure for building Web applications, and it has been completely re-architected to provide a highly productive programming experience based on the .NET Framework.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">.NET Extensibility</span>&#160;– .NET Extensibility lets managed code developers change, add, and extend Web server functionality in the request pipeline, the configuration, and the UI. Developers can use the familiar ASP.NET extensibility model and rich .NET APIs to build Web Server features that are just as powerful as those written using the native C++ APIs.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">ISAPI Extensions</span>&#160;– Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) Extensions provides support for dynamic Web content development using ISAPI extensions. An ISAPI extension runs when requested, just like any other static HTML file or dynamic ASP file. Since ISAPI applications are compiled code, they are processed much faster than ASP files or files that call COM+ components.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">ISAPI Filters</span>&#160;– Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) Filters provides support for Web applications that use ISAPI filters. ISAPI filters are files that can extend or change the functionality provided by IIS. An ISAPI filter reviews every request made to the Web server, until the filter finds one that it needs to process.</li>

            <li><span class="ui">HTTP Logging—</span>HTTP Logging provides logs site activity for this server. When a loggable event (usually an HTTP transaction) occurs, IIS calls the selected logging module, which then writes to one of the logs stored in the file system of the Web server. These logs are kept in addition to those provided by the operating system.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Request Monitoring</span>—Request Monitor provides infrastructure to monitor Web application health by capturing information about HTTP requests in an IIS worker process. Administrators and developers can use Request Monitor to understand which HTTP requests are executing in a worker process when the worker process has become unresponsive or very slow.</li>

        <ol start="1" class="number-list">
            <li><span class="ui">Windows Authentication</span>&#160;– Windows Authentication is a low-cost authentication solution for internal websites. This authentication scheme allows administrators in a Windows domain to take advantage of the domain infrastructure for authenticating users. Do not use Windows authentication if users who must be authenticated access an organization's website from behind firewalls and proxy servers.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Request Filtering</span>&#160;– Request Filtering screens all incoming requests to the server and filters these requests based on rules set by the administrator. Many malicious attacks share common characteristics, such as very long URLs, or requests for an unusual action. Filtering requests, can attempt to reduce the impact of these types of attacks.</li>

        <p><span class="ui">Static Content Compression</span>&#160;– Static Content Compression provides infrastructure to configure HTTP compression of static content. This provides more efficient use of bandwidth. Unlike dynamic responses, compressed static responses can be cached without degrading CPU resources.</p>
