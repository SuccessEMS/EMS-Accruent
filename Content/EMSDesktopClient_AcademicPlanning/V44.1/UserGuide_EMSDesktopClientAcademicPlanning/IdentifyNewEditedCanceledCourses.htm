            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Identify New, Edited, or Canceled Courses</h1>
        <p>After the academic units have made their modifications to the course schedule, you must&#160;identify&#160;and compile a list of modifications and enter the approved changes in the Student Information System (SIS). EMS Academic Planning flags course changes using a field named Course State. New, edited, and canceled courses are marked as “New,” “Edited,” and “Canceled,” respectively. Typically, you generate the Course Changes report to view and identify the requested course changes; however, if further clarification is needed, then you can use the Academic Browser and/or Course Navigator.</p>

            <p>For detailed information about generating the Course Changes report, and the information that is contained in the report, see&#160;<a href="GenerateAcadReports.htm">Generating Academic Reports</a>.</p>

            <p>Prior to reviewing the modifications, you can remove access to the term from your academic units. See&#160;<a href="EnableDisableTermSetPrefMode.htm">Enable/Disable a Term for Set Preferences Mode</a>.</p>
