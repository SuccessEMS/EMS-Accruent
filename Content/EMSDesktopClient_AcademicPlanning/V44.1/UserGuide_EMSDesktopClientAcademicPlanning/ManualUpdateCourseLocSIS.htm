        <p>If any errors are encountered during the publishing process, or if the EMS Academic Planning system parameter Manually Update SIS/ERP System After Publishing is set to “Yes,” then you can access your course list and manually&#160;update&#160;the course locations in your SIS.</p>

            <li>On the Domain dropdown list, select the domain for which you are manually updating the course locations.</li>
            <li>Select the term for which you are manually updating the course locations, and then click Update SIS.&#160;The Courses Not Updated in SIS window opens. This window lists all the courses that were not updated in the SIS along with an accompanying reason. If the reason is an error, you must resolve the error before you can continue with the manual publishing. If “Manual Publish” required is listed, then you can continue with this procedure.&#160;</li>
