        <h1>Publish a Final Exam Session</h1>
        <p>After you have created the final exam schedule template for the term, and updated any final exam settings, you must publish the final exam session. Publishing a final exam session is a two part process. First, you must&#160;create&#160;a final exam session and specify a start date for the session. Second, you must then apply a final exam schedule template to the final exam session and then you can&#160;publish&#160;the session.&#160;</p>

            <p>Unless the option to require the same room was selected for a course, course preferences can be considered and the final exam for the course can be scheduled in another room through optimization.

            <li>Click <span class="ui">Close </span>to close the View Bookings window and return to the Final Exam Sessions window.&#160;The final exam session publishing process adds the final exam for each course as a separate booking in the course's reservation.

You can use the Final Exam Schedule report to review the final exam schedule or the Final Exam Settings report to view optional settings. (See&#160;<a href="GenerateAcadReports.htm">Generate Academic Reports</a>.) To open the View Bookings window again, click View on the Final Exam Sessions window.
