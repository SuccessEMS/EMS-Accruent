        <h1>Using the Course Navigator</h1>
        <p>The Course Navigator is a window in EMS Academic Planning that you use to view and manage all aspects of a course. You can&#160;access&#160;the Course Navigator from the Academic Browser, the Academic Book, and the EMS Navigator. Different&#160;tabs&#160;and&#160;panes&#160;on the Course Navigator provide different information about a course and course dates. The&#160;actions&#160;that you can carry out in the Course Navigator depend upon the mode (Read Only, Define and Edit Courses, Set Preferences, or Dual) that is enabled for the academic term with which you are working in EMS Academic Planning.</p>
        <p>You can access the Course Navigator from the Academic Browser, the Academic Book, and the EMS Navigator.</p>
