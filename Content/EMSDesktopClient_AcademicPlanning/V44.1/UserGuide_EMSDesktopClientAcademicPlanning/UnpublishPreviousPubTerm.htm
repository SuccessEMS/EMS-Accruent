        <h1>Unpublish a Previously Published Academic Term</h1>
        <p>For a variety of reasons, you might need to&#160;unpublish&#160;a previously published term, for example, you accidentally published the term using the wrong scenario, or you forgot to mark excluded dates before you published the term.</p>
        <div class="ImportantNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #990000;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Important! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>Even though you might have a valid reason for unpublishing a term, do not do so without great consideration. Unpublishing a term deletes all reservations and bookings that are associated with the term.</p>
        </div>
        <p>To unpublish a previously published academic term, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="number-list">
            <li>
                <p>On the EMS Academic Planning menu bar, click <span class="ui">Academic Planning </span>&gt; <span class="ui">Courses </span>&gt; <span class="ui">Manage Terms.</span>&#160;</p>
                <p>The Terms window opens.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">
                <p>On the Domain drop-down list, select the domain for which you are unpublishing the term.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">
                <p>Select the term that you are unpublishing, and then click <b>Unpublish</b>.&#160;</p>
                <p>A message opens indicating that unpublishing will remove all reservations and bookings for the selected term, and asking you if it is OK to continue.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">
                <p>Click <span class="ui">Yes</span>.&#160;The message closes. </p>
                <p>After the term is unpublished, a second message opens indicating that the term was successfully unpublished.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">
                <p>Click <span class="ui">OK </span>to close the second message and return to the Terms window.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
