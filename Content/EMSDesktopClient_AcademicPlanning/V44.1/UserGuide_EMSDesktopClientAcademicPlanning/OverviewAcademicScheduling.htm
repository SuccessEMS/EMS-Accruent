        <h1>Overview of the Academic Scheduling Process</h1>
        <p>The academic scheduling process is a multi-step process for enabling online communication between the Domain Scheduler and academic units, optimizing academic space use, and creating reservations in EMS Academic Planning for academic courses. To use the full functionality of EMS Academic Planning, it is important that you understand the&#160;academic&#160;scheduling specific terms&#160;that are used in EMS Academic Planning and that you have a high-level understanding of the&#160;academic scheduling configuration process.</p>
        <h2>Academic Scheduling Specific Terms Used in EMS Campus&#160;</h2>
        <p>While meeting/event scheduling and academic scheduling have many features in common, EMS Academic Planning uses terms that are specific to the academic scheduling configuration process.</p>

        <h2>Academic Scheduling Configuration Process</h2>
        <p>Before academic scheduling can be even be carried out, the following must be in place in your EMS database:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>Core data—building, rooms, instructors, course types, and subjects—must be synchronized with the Student Information System (SIS).</li>
            <li>Academic domains and academic units must be configured.</li>
            <li>Academic users must be configured with the appropriate security settings.</li>
            <li>Default values for academic parameters must be set.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>See the <a href="../../../EMSDesktopClient/V44.1/ConfigurationGuide/2_EMS_Desktop_Client_CG.htm">EMS Desktop Client Configuration Guide</a> for detailed instructions about configuring and synchronizing this needed academic data.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Although the academic scheduling configuration process varies from one academic site to another, typically, the same two-phase process, the Academic Planning phase and the Post-Publishing phase, is carried out, and each process typically has the same high-level steps.</p>
        <h2><a name="Academic_Planning_Phase"></a>Academic Planning Phase</h2>
        <p>The Academic Planning Phase is the first phase carried out in the academic scheduling process. This phase typically has the following high-level steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Importing an Academic Term. See <a href="#Importing_an_Academic_Term">Importing an Academic Term</a>.</li>
            <li>Defining and Editing Courses. See <a href="SynchronizeCourses.htm">Defining and Editing Courses</a>.</li>
            <li>Settings Preferences. See <a href="SpecifyRoomPrefReq.htm">Specifying Room Preferences.</a></li>
        </ol>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>You can carry out Step 2 and Step 3 individually, or you can carry them out simultaneously using Dual Mode. </p>
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>Assigning rooms and optimizing. See <a href="ReviewVerifyRoomPref.htm">Review and Verify Room Preferences</a>.</li>
            <li>Publishing terms in EMS. See <a href="PublishTerm.htm">Publishing a Term.</a></li>
            <li>Once you have published a term:<ol><li>A new term is created in the SIS either by rolling forward a previous term or by creating it from scratch. The term is synchronized into EMS.</li><li>The Domain Scheduler synchronizes the course schedule data from the campus SIS into EMS Campus.</li><li>Academic units review the course schedule data in the Campus web client and make change requests as appropriate for new, edited, or canceled sections and/or mark the courses that Share Space.</li><li>The Domain Scheduler reviews the changes and shared space settings in EMS Campus, modifies the data in the SIS and resynchronizes the updated course schedule into EMS Campus to synchronize the two systems.</li><li>The Domain Scheduler and/or academic units submit room preferences for courses.</li><li>Pre-assignments are completed and scenarios are created that apply weighted values to the preferences in order to meet organizational criteria for room scheduling and to make the best use of space.</li><li>The Domain Scheduler publishes the schedule to create reservations and bookings in EMS Campus for all academic courses and write the course location information back to the SIS.</li></ol></li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Post-Publishing_Phase"></a>Post-Publishing Phase</h2>
        <p>The Post-Publishing Phase is the second phase carried out in the academic scheduling process. This phase typically has the following high-level steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Reviewing reservations and resolving room assignments.</li>
            <li>Creating a synchronization schedule.</li>
            <li>Creating and publishing a final exam session.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For all these tasks, see <a href="Post-PubProcCourses.htm">Post-Publish Processing of Courses</a>. Once you have completed them:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Domain Scheduler reviews the room reservations and resolves unassigned courses or displaced event reservations.</li>
            <li>A synchronization schedule is created to keep EMS up to date with changes that are made in the SIS.</li>
            <li>The Domain Scheduler creates and publishes a final exam session for the term.</li>
