        <h1>Post-Publish Processing of Courses</h1>
        <p>In most cases, courses are added, changed, or canceled in the SIS after the course schedule has been published in EMS. You can manually resynchronize and&#160;process&#160;these courses, or you can set options in EMS Academic Planning to automatically resynchronize these courses. After these course are automatically resynchronized, they can be automatically processed as well, or you can manually&#160;process&#160;them. Also, at the point that actual enrollment should determine room assignment (that is, can a room’s capacity handle the actual enrollment), you can&#160;process&#160;courses post-publish so that the courses are updated with the actual enrollment.&#160;</p>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>For automatic synchronizing to occur, the EMS Academic Planning Auto Sync Service must be installed and configured. Refer to the EMS Installation manual for details.</p>

                <p>Select the term which requires post-publish processing, and then click <span class="ui">Sync</span>.&#160;</p>
                <p>The Course Updates window opens. The <span class="ui">Course </span>tab is the active tab. This tab displays all the new courses, new course dates, changed courses, or canceled courses from the SIS. After processing, it also lists <span class="italics">Room Capacity Violations</span>, or courses in which the designated enrollment (estimated or actual) has surpassed the capacity of the room. The Course Updates window also has a <span class="ui">Crosslist Validation</span> tab. When EMS changes a cross-list parent to accommodate a new course, course date, or change that is being processed, the cross-listed courses are displayed on the <span class="ui">Crosslist Validation </span>tab. The <span class="ui">Crosslist Validation</span> tab is for informational purposes only so that you are kept abreast of parent changes. </p>
                <p>If you are satisfied with the parent assignments, you can simply click <span class="ui">Reviewed </span>and the cross-listed courses are cleared from the tab; otherwise, a Set Parent option is available.</p>
