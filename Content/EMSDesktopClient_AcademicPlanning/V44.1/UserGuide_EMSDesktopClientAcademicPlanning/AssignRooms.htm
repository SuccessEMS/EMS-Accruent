            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Assign Rooms</h1>
        <p>After you have completed pre-assignment of rooms and/or room optimization, four options are available to resolve room assignments:</p>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li><span class="ui">Assign</span>—the Assign option lists all rooms regardless of availability or preferences. It is intended to provide a means for you to quickly assign a room without going through the search process.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Search</span>—the Search option initially lists any preferences and requirements that were specified during the Set Preferences mode. You can use these preferences as a basis for a room search or you can specify and/or clear other criteria to complete the room search.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Unassign</span>—the Unassign option removes the Assigned status for a course. You can then use the Assign option or the Search option to assign a different room to the course. The Unassign option is available after you assign a room to a course, or search for a room, and then assign it to a course.</li>
            <li><span class="ui">Swap</span>—the Swap option allows you to swap the room assignments of two courses. The swap option is only available after selecting two courses that have identical meeting patterns&#160;and that have been assigned to rooms.</li>
        </ol>
