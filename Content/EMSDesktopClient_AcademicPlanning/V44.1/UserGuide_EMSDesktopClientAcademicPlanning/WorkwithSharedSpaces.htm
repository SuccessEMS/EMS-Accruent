    </head>

        <h1>Work with Shared Space</h1>
        <p>The&#160;shared space&#160;designation is used for two or more courses that are not cross-listed in the SIS, but that have matching patterns and are meant to be held in the same room. The shared space designation links the courses together for the set preferences, optimization, publishing, and final exam scheduling functions. Shared space is&#160;assigned&#160;in a parent-child relationship. If needed, you can&#160;change&#160;the parent designation. In addition, if a course that is cross-listed in the SIS is not meant to be held in the same room, or if courses that are marked as shared space are no longer meant to share space, then you can&#160;reverse&#160;the shared space designation. You can also&#160;review&#160;shared spaced designations.</p>
        <p>Academic units that have the appropriate permissions can indicate shared space using the EMS Campus Planning Interface. You might want to review these shared space settings before working with shared space.</p>

        <h2><a name="Change"></a>Change the Parent Designation for Shared Space/Cross-listed Spaces</h2>
        <p>When you set the shared space designation for courses, EMS Academic Planning arbitrarily specifies one of the courses as the parent course. The academic unit that controls the parent course is the unit that sets the preferences for the shared courses in the Set Preferences mode. If the academic unit that you want to set the preferences in the Set Preferences mode is not currently the parent course, then you can change the parent designation for the courses. Also, after you publish courses, you can change the room only for the parent course and the child course “just follows along.” If the course on which you want to base the room change is not currently the parent course, then you can change the parent designation for the courses.</p>
