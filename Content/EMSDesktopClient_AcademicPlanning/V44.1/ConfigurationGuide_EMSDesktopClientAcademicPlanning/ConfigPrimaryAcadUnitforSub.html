            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Configure the Primary Academic Unit for a Subject</h1>
        <p>Typically, a <span class="italics">subject </span>is associated with a single <span class="italics">academic unit</span>; however, there might be times when you must assign a subject to multiple academic units, or departments. For example, you might need to assign a History class to a department in the College of Arts and Sciences and to a department in the College of Liberal Arts. In this case, you must&#160;configure&#160;a&#160;primary academic unit for the subject. A primary academic unit for a subject ensures the following:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li class="ListParagraph">When EMS assigns a building preference to a course that belongs to a shared subject, it uses the building preference for the primary academic unit.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">When EMS publishes a course that belongs to a shared subject, it uses the Group, Event Type, and Reservation Source for the primary academic unit.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">When a course that belongs to a shared subject is displayed in the Navigator or Course Navigator, the primary academic unit for the course is displayed on the Course Info tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To configure the primary academic unit for a subject, do the following:</p>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li class="ListParagraph">On the EMS Academic Planning menu bar, click <span class="ui">Academic Planning</span> &gt; <span class="ui">Configuration </span>&gt;&#160;<span class="ui">Subjects</span>.&#160;The Subjects window opens, listing all the subjects currently configured in your EMS database for the indicated domain.<p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Installing Campus Planning Interface/Configuring the Primary Academic.png" alt="emssg_EMSCampus_image014.png" style="width: 657px; height: 305px;" class="resize80_noborder_padding" /></p></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">On the Domain drop-down list, select the domain for which you are configuring the subject, select the appropriate subject, and then click&#160;<span class="ui">Edit</span>.&#160;The Subject dialog box opens. This dialog box lists the code and description for the selected subject and the code for the selected domain.<div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><p>This information was imported from your SIS and you cannot edit it.</p></div><p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Installing Campus Planning Interface/Configuring the Primary Academic_1.png" alt="emssg_EMSCampus_image015.png" style="width: 634px; height: 277px;" class="resize80_noborder_padding" /></p></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Select the primary academic unit for the subject. (The default value is <span class="ui">None</span>.)</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Click&#160;<span class="ui">OK</span>.&#160;The Subject dialog box closes. You return to the Subjects window with the newly configured subject automatically selected.</li>
