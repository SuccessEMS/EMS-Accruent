            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Configure Domains</h1>
        <p>A <span class="italics">domain</span>&#160;is a level of organization within an institution that defines scheduling responsibility. Functions such as synchronizing, optimizing, and running reports are carried out on a per domain basis. When you configure your domain, you must identify the subjects that are offered in the domain and you must also specify the rooms that are controlled by the domain. The subjects that are defined within a domain determine the courses listed for the domain. The rooms that are defined within a domain determine all spaces that are potentially scheduled by the courses. Subjects can belong to only one domain. Rooms can belong to multiple domains.</p>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>The term domain is controlled by an EMS system parameter (Campus: Domain Title Singular and Campus: Domain Title Plural), and it is often changed to Campus or School to better describe how course scheduling is divided. See <a href="../../../EMSDesktopClient/V44.1/ConfigurationGuide/EditSysParam.htm">Edit System Parameters</a>.</p>
