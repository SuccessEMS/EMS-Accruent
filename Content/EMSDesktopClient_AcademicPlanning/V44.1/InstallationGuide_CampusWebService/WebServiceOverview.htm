        <h1>Web Service Overview</h1>
        <h2>EMS Campus Application Architecture</h2>
        <p>The EMS Campus Web Service communicates with the SIS database via views.&#160; An installation script is provided during your implementation that will be executed against your SIS database to create the necessary views.&#160;The EMS Campus Web Service interacts directly with these views to handle all querying and updating room assignments.</p>
        <h2>EMS-SIS Data Synchronization</h2>
        <p>The EMS Campus Web Service synchronizes the following information from the SIS:</p>
        <h3>Facility Information</h3>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>
                <p>Buildings (via ems_vwBuildings view)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Room Types (via ems_vwRoomTypes view)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rooms (via ems_vwRooms view)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Course Related Information</h3>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>
                <p>Subjects (via ems_vwSubjects view)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Instructors (via ems_vwInstructors view)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Course Types (via ems_vwCourseTypes view)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Terms (via ems_vwTerms view)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Courses and Course Dates (via ems_vwCourses and ems_vwCourseDates views)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a1a1a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p>An extra view – ems_vwCourseDates_IDs is provided for customers using Banner and PeopleSoft for their SIS.</p>
        </div>
        <p>When publishing your course schedule in EMS or when changing room assignments in EMS post-publish, the EMS Campus Web Service updates course room information in your SIS.&#160;This is the only information that the EMS Campus Web Service updates in the SIS database.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>EMS/SIS Synchronization</h2>
        <p>Synchronization functions are executed by the Domain Scheduler using the EMS Campus client application.&#160; After changes are made in the SIS, the EMS Campus Web Service pulls that information into EMS Campus when a sync is ran from the Manage Terms screen.</p>
        <p>When the Domain Scheduler publishes a term in EMS, reservations and bookings are created in EMS and updates to course room assignments are pushed back to the SIS.&#160; Post-publish changes to course room assignments made in EMS are automatically updated in the SIS.</p>
        <h2>Other Synchronization Options</h2>
        <p>If creating database views in your SIS is not possible, the following alternative is possible:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If an SIS is not available or is incompatible with the EMS Campus, you can use course-related data from files exported from your SIS in a tab-delimited format. This method is a one-way import. EMS Campus will not update course room assignments back into your SIS. </p>
                <p>See&#160;<a href="FormatTabDelimitedFiles.htm">Format for Tab-Delimited Files</a>&#160;for file format information.</p>
