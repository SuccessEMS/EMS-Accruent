        <h1>EMS Mobile App Installation Guide</h1>
        <p>EMS Mobile App, available on iOS and Android smartphones, is designed primarily for everyday users "on the go." It allows users to make simple reservations in unmanaged spaces (i.e., spaces without services and approvals), such as workspaces and open conference rooms. For example, Everyday Users can:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>Book a meeting space with a few attendees while traveling from their hotel room</li>
            <li>Change the time and/or room for an existing booking</li>
            <li>View where their upcoming meeting is located</li>
            <li>Check-in to or cancel their upcoming meeting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>EMS Mobile App uses your phone's hardware features. You can use your phone's camera to scan a QR code to book or check-in to meetings. Administrators can set a proximity-based check-in distance so that users will be able to check-in to their meeting when they are within a certain distance of the building.</p>
