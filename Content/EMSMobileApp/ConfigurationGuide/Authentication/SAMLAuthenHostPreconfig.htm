        <p><span class="ui">Hosted Configuration:</span>&#160;The configuration can be hosted at a URL available to end users.&#160;The user will then enter that URL into the application. EMS Mobile App will download and use that information, and kick off the authentication process. When configured this way, users will launch the EMS Mobile App and see the EMS Server URL screen. Instead of entering an&#160;EMS Server URL, the user will&#160;tap&#160;<span class="ui">About&#160;</span>near the bottom right of the screen and select the&#160;option to&#160;<span class="ui">Import SSO Configuration</span>. The user will then tap&#160;<span class="ui">Import&#160;</span>Mobile app, which will direct the user to enter the&#160;<span class="ui">Configuration URL</span>.&#160;Then the user will tap&#160;<span class="ui">Import</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="ui">Pre-Configured In EMS Mobile App: </span>The configuration can be&#160;"baked" into the application.&#160;This requires&#160;<a href="../Mobile_ConfigRe-signMobilePrivDeploy.html">re-signing</a>, hosting, and re-distributing the EMS Mobile App within your organization.&#160;With a pre-configured EMS Mobile App users do not need&#160;to import any SAML configuration details. <MadCap:variable name="General.Mobile" /> will launch with that configuration and use it directly.</p>
        <h2>How Users Authenticate After&#160;Configuration&#160;</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Mobile_Authentication/SAML Authentication Can Be_1.png" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/5914/clipboard_e78ab7c4fa94c608aea8bd7035c362fbc.png?revision=1" class="popup_with_padding_and_border" />
        </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.Mobile" /> makes a request to the configured or default SAML URL</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>If the request redirects the user to the SAML authentication web page, then the web user will see the page in a web view inside <MadCap:variable name="General.Mobile" />.</li>
            <li>The user might briefly see a busy indicator while the page loads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users will authenticate using the SAML authorization view. They&#160;do not participate in the steps that follow. They&#160;may, however, see the screen change during this process.&#160;Successful authentication will send an HTML response back to <MadCap:variable name="General.Mobile" />, which will&#160;silently&#160;POST&#160;the SAML form and response to the&#160;EMS Platform Services&#160;API.&#160;&#160;EMS Platform Services&#160;API will then parse the SAML response and find the corresponding user in the EMS database. Then EMS&#160;Platform Services&#160;API will respond to <MadCap:variable name="General.Mobile" />, which will&#160;direct the user to the&#160;Home&#160;screen.&#160;If the&#160;EMS Platform Services&#160;API is unable to verify the credentials, <MadCap:variable name="General.Mobile" /> will present an error message informing the user.</p>
        <h2>How the Identity Provider (IdP) Works&#160;</h2>
        <p>The Identity Provider (IdP) handles the input and verification of end user credentials. It also issues and verifies tokens.&#160;The EMS Mobile App must be registered with the IdP. The&#160;client_id&#160;generated by this registration is required information for the configuration used by the EMS Mobile App and the SAML flow.</p>
        <h2>How the EMS Platform Services API Works</h2>
        <p>The&#160;EMS Platform Services&#160;API receives the&#160;access_token&#160;from the EMS Mobile App. The token is then sent to the&#160;userinfo&#160;endpoint for verification. The response from the&#160;userinfoendpoint is used to find a user in the EMS database. The API will then respond to the EMS Mobile App&#160;based on the results of this process.</p>
